Often derivative and lacking creativity, they never seem to hit the same as the item they were based off on. Persona is obviously no stranger to spinoffs - if you're reading this you're on a spinoff title right now - and they're definitely on the more meh side of games. The Persona Dancing games range from awful to pretty good, the P4 Arena games were ok, and though I've not played the Persona Q games, I hear that they're not the best. Perfectly average can describe most Persona spinoff titles, so I went into Persona 5 Strikers with the same idea in mind.\n\nHonestly though, perfectly average would've suited me just fine. I had just come off of the high of P5R and desperately wanted to be with these characters more, so a game of any quality would've been fine. God, did I get that and more. While obviously not as good as P5R, P5S is still an extremely good game (a 11/10 to a 8.5/10). P5S has more heart and soul put into it than I ever expected; it really does feel like an actual sequel sometimes. From a enjoyable gameplay to a gripping story to excellent themes and characters, P5S really blew my expectations out of the water. *spoilers from here on out*\n\nTo get the gameplay out of the way first, it's fun! It trades the typical turn-based gameplay of normal Persona games for a more action-based hack-and-slash one. Combos that weaved in melee, guns, and of course Personas, there were tons of different moves that kept the gameplay relatively fresh. Each character also has their own unique movesets, all of which are extremely distinct from one another, which only adds to the fun of combat. I will say though, once into NG+ and just grinding for that final achievement, the gameplay began to get a bit repetitive. While the other characters are fun, it's simply more efficient to stay on the main character Joker for the entire time while grinding which ended up getting on my nerves. Overall, the gameplay is a surprising yet pleasant shift from the typical gameplay of the Persona series.\n\nThe story is really where P5S begins to get elite. While a bit derivative from previous Persona games, I was extremely engaged and invested in the story of P5S. Similar to P5R's Palace rulers are P5S's Jail rulers, and I'd go to argue that some of the Jail rulers are better than most of the Palace ones. Akira Konoe of P5S really stands out as an excellent villain (he has the best soundtrack out of ANY Persona game). He's simply written so well, with believable motivations and a truly heartbreaking backstory. What P5S does more than P5R is really humanize its villains. While there is merit in simply having an irredeemable villain, I prefer ones which are more complex and serve as foils to the heroes. I truly do think that P5S accomplishes this better than P5R. They're not perfect, almost nothing is (though I will say Maruki in P5R gets very close), but the villains are still all extremely good.\n\nThe themes of the game are also heartfelt. \"Finding what it means to be human\" is a common trope in media, though I'd argue that it's common because it's a great theme. I do think it's often overlooked what this theme means to the human characters of the story. P5S starts with all the characters coming off of their P5R arcs, yet this theme somehow gave even more growth to all these characters. \n\nSpeaking of characters, god I love them all SO MUCH. The main cast are as good as ever, if not even better. While everyone gets to shine, the game puts a priority in giving characters who got less screen time (Ann, Yusuke, and Haru) full arcs to really flesh out their characters. I somehow feel even more connected to this goofy group of kids than I did before, and I'm overjoyed about that. But the real stars of the show are the new characters: Zenkichi and Sophia. I'm not sure why they cooked so hard with these two, but I'm so glad they did. I won't spoil anything about these two, but just know they're absolutely amazing characters.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers surprised the hell out of me. It's, in my opinion, the standard to which all spinoffs should try to hit. There was clear effort put into it, and it shows in the final product. From fun gameplay to an amazing story and cast of characters, I feel that anyone is guaranteed to have a good time. 8.5/10; if you like Persona, you have to play this game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8e59e6d48d8b59a685cb99a2080703a0", "author": "f312f2f8d30252de9672cc284e6a07f1", "date": "2025-03-16", "hours": 4657, "content": "peaksona musou, good af", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3356490f16d55741a91e249d3e83010d", "author": "4e13d8dc92965d79b75fc270f873d4b3", "date": "2025-03-16", "hours": 1090, "content": "Fun when it works, but it constantly freezes, most of the time requiring a system restart, making it unplayable 99% of the time.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "89b3f957956952cc8adfa9dd1f8285bc", "author": "cb809f2ee927506c8f4c75301051abbb", "date": "2025-03-14", "hours": 214, "content": "Great game best sequal possible for p5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "271a762695545fb7b269f72f5d4ad5df", "author": "d9a4ced4c8d45982a4abddfbf095b8ee", "date": "2025-03-14", "hours": 4151, "content": "greetings snake king i will kill you for 15 hours straight #onsight", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "69e512fc4fab57cfbbc685707672670f", "author": "a96f5caad4d3584e9323e7fd2714f967", "date": "2025-03-10", "hours": 4096, "content": "ts so beautiful\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b42af377f45652ed803c30857e7811aa", "author": "d51bac67860559be97394184835c8af9", "date": "2025-03-08", "hours": 2871, "content": "\"nostalgia\" and interacting with characters you liked makes the game better but imo\nthe game overstays its welcome a little.\nStory is decent combat is okay but i'd prefer the turnbased system.\n\n7/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bc581ddb8f32506181e4da1d3cefd0a9", "author": "ad28f96182d951d3926f1c8449d07dfe", "date": "2025-03-06", "hours": 3490, "content": "\u7f8e\u597d\u5605\u6691\u5047\u5b8c\u7d50\u5566\uff0c\u5f8c\u6703\u6709\u671f\uff0c\u602a\u76dc\u5718\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ab6a426a89a752dbb8f01011a3805109", "author": "c24840ac1f12562f973bfb3e1b6af53c", "date": "2025-03-06", "hours": 5981, "content": "I never saw it coming...", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7b1d204506345f889ed09df1e8f7682e", "author": "c557a4e197a9545bbb01d9cdc4d5288f", "date": "2025-03-06", "hours": 3651, "content": "A sequel to the original non-royal version of the Persona 5.

I feel it lacks the full oomph that persona usually has. I will say though that it does pick up after the third jail and it gets a load of more fun and interesting after that)\n\nSetting:10/10(You\u2019re going on a roadtrip all over Japan, that\u2019s a weebs wet dream! Seriously though the real world locations AND the jails are greatly well done. I have no complaints on the actual jails/dungeons. My favorite jails would have to be sapporo and kyoto)\n\nArt:9/10(Now the art should be a 10/10 and if I didn\u2019t have technical issues that ruined gameplay and how my game had ran the whole time then it would have but that isn\u2019t the case. Judging the game itself though,the art is pretty much the same,no improvements and there didn\u2019t have to be so no complaints really)\n\nMusic:10/10(This is persona,of course the music is stellar and perfect. There\u2019s alot of original songs but they have a couple of remixed songs from base persona and that\u2019s cool. Lyn is back for singing because of course she has to be. Perfection!)\n\nCharacters:10/10(The gang is back and it\u2019s better than ever with (spoiler alert) TWO new members to add to the phantom fray! Sophia and Zenkichi. I really got attached to Sophia the moment she was introduced. She\u2019s such a sweetheart and her character arc is amazing to see. As for Zenkichi\u2026\u2026.He\u2019s also pretty cool. I don\u2019t like him as much as Sophia but he\u2019s still a phenomenal character and he has his own character growth. Two new characters getting a whole character arc in the game where the rest of the cast already has had theirs is a neat plot Device to put in. It really helps someone like Sophia have a foundation when she falters or needs a helping hand, she\u2019s surrounded by people who know what she\u2019s going through and can help along the way.)\n\nBattle/fights:8/10(I am not really the Musou type of gamer. I don\u2019t like them at all but persona and fate are an exception since they\u2019re IP\u2019s that\u2019s I\u2019m Familiar with and not just familiar, i love both franchises ALOT. I started the game kind of frustrated with the gameplay since I\u2019m not fond of it but by the third jail I was having a grand ole time. Compared to fate/samurai remnant I think this is quite a bit better) \n\nOverall:9/10\nGreat game.

(camera, phantom dashes interrupting one more, etc...). What I don't understand is why they didn't embrace the idea of it being a sort of 1.5 sequel?

I had originally played it on Switch just before going on vacation so the aspect of joining the Phantom Thieves on vacation was really fun. Recently I got the itch to play the game again and relive the story once more. This game is 100% better with a controller over the keyboard and despite my favorite detective not being in it, I'd happily play it over and over again.\r\n\r\nAs of writing I just started NG+ on Merciless and it's a different beast. The difficulty spike is insane compared to Merciless in Royal being barely different from the regular difficulty. That level 2 Pixie and Jack-O'_Lantern in the tutorial are now level 87~. Dire Shadows are more like Souls Bosses if you're not prepared for them, good luck not getting one shot.\r\n\r\nPlaytime Hours, how long you can expect the game to be if it's not your first rodeo\r\n\r\n40 hours to beat the game paying attention to story. Time progresses with the story so you dont have to wait a thousand years for something to happen and the boss fights are pretty easy if you bring the right teammate\r\n\r\n50 if you do all the quests along the way\r\n\r\n60 to finish what you started. I would say \"Grind to completion\" here but honestly it's much easier to grind completion once you start a merciless run since 100%ing the compendium would take so much longer without the xp boost from being able to fight higher level enemies out the gate.\r\n\r\n100+ if you want to suffer with the Merciless difficulty, but in order to even unlock it you must do all boss refights and their EX refight quests along with The Reaper. \r\n\r\nGetting the last handful of achievments is a lot easier here since you can quickly get anyone you didnt originally use to level 70 off the first few enemies in the Jail. Your main team may be around level 80-85 but anyone you didnt use may be stuck in the level 60 limbo. Dire Shadows also don't respawn in regular difficulties but on Merciless they will and are a fantastic source of BOND XP. Grinding points to fill out the last 5 personas in the compendium may be a huge pain in the rear before you get to the next Jail due to it requiring personas that were originally level 20-30. Since everything is at a higher level, it's more worth it to just grab those little guys as you progress the story while saving your points on the higher level guys that only need 2-5 levels.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy this game just as much as I have.

That's right in Persona 5 Strikers the speed with which you move the mouse is inversely proportional to your camera speed, meaning that the slowest and tiniest of mouse movements will make your camera twitch erratically, while the fastest flicks will barely move it at all.   \n\nI wish someone was there to warn me about this before I bought the game.

The story is great, you unlock all the important game mechanics by the end of the second arc, so the gameplay is great from there till the end. If you played dynasty warriors or any other koei tecmo game and didn't like it, I still recommend playing this. The game is just great. Combat is fun, fast and stylish, while still not straying too far from persona gameplay, The characters are all fun to play as and have movesets that fit their personalities. The story is on-par with the original P5 and the social segments are great, although they have been moved from optional side content to the main story. The only parts I didn't like were the first two arcs cause they're lighter on story, the gameplay is far more shallow here due to not having cooking and side quests which give you more stuff to do and just make the game seem bigger. These arcs are also very over-tutorialised. There's a lot of walking for 5 seconds, only to then stop and listen to the characters explain a mechanic or objective that you really could have figured out on your own, or at the very least doesn't require the entire game to stop to tell you. Other than those first like 12-15 hours the game is great. I should also mention that this game can be quite challenging if you play on the harder difficulties and requires an understanding of both the action and RPG elements of the combat system.

I am a big fan of Atlus games, I've beaten P4, P5, P5D, P5R, SMTV Vengeance and Metaphor from start to finish. Unfortunately, beating Strikers felt like a chore.\nI'd give this game a 5/10  \nTLDR story was mostly rehashed, the gameplay is repetitive and it clearly lacks the polish and love that the previous games had. I'd only recommend this game for its slice-of-life moments outside the main story. Only buy it on sale. You could even save money by watching the story on YouTube instead. If you do buy it, play it on easy mode to avoid boring HP sponge bosses\n\nVISUALS:\nPros: \nThe pre-rendered cutscenes are better than Royal's. I would love to see more of this quality for future games. There are new anime cutscenes and those are stunning as well. It's wholesome to see the Phantom Thieves in a 1 year time skip with different outfits.\n\nCons:\nThe in-game graphics are a big downgrade. I guess this is a given because it's a spin-off, this was made by a different studio and they had to make the game compatible with the Switch. It is very jarring to go from Royal to Strikers. This is evident if you examine the screenshots provided by the Steam advertisement (screenshots 7/8 or 8/8 specifically) or watch 10 minutes of any gameplay footage. You can see a lot of jaggedness in the models and environments. Even the calendar UI in the top-left corner is a clear downgrade. The best fix I could find was changing my rendering scale to 2.0 but that only fixed the models. The best assets in this game are likely reused from Royal or P5 Vanilla, such as the face assets when a character is talking. All-out attacks do not have the flashy art they once had in Royal and instead use the ugly in-game models.\n\nSTORY\nPros: \nThe best parts are when the Phantom Thieves need to stall X days for the main story to progress or celebrate main story progression. I enjoyed these parts more than the overall story because they actually felt brand new and watching the interaction between characters was very charming. There are some moments in the main story that tugs at heartstrings. The new party members are enjoyable and wholesome too.\n\nCons:\nThe story felt too similar to its predecessor, a lot of the plot felt the same but reskinned. I think I could summarize the plot as the same as P5 but with AI as a plot device instead of the meta-nav app.\n\nMINOR STRIKER AND P5/P5R STORY SPOILERS SKIP TO GAMEPLAY SECTION\nThe following is a list of rehashes that all happened in Royal: Ann gets a greater narrative focus because of her emotional connection to the villain in the first palace. Yusuke gets a greater narritive focus in the 2nd palace. You befriend a new character who doesnt remember their past (Morgana rehash). You even befriend an older person who has a job involving the law (Sae rehash) similar to Royal. Phantom Theives are framed for cognitive murder. Palaces, palace rulers, and change of heart with a calling card are present but the game labels it as something else when it clearly plays out the same. This makes the writing feel lazy and makes the overall game feel like a cash grab.\n\nThere's also some plot inconsistencies. Joker unmasks himself on a jumbo TV for the first palace and the biggest Phantom Thief fan that makes YouTube content about them doesn't recognize him face-to-face in-person. Phantom Theives don't really bother to hide their identity when confronted with cops, Ann literally saying \"\u201cwe\u2019ve cleared our names\u201d. There's no plot concerns about going into the metaverse in a public park with multiple witnesses present. Cops calling concepts of the metaverse \"crazy\" when Joker was arrested for such a case a year ago. \n\nGAMEPLAY\nPros:\nYou get to finally walk around as a Phantom Thief that's not Joker. It was so fun to run around as Morgana (I love his swirly circle leg running animation) and punch and kick as Makoto. They took the time to have the Phantom Thieves play differently and I love that. Pressing Y on Ann vs pressing it on the rest of the cast does different things. So each Phantom Thief has their own gimmick and it was fun to learn each of their combos. If you do X combo you can finish it with Y persona spell at a reduced dmg costing no sp. I really liked that combo system, it is a very unique approach because it integrates elemental weakness directly into combat, rather than relying solely on Persona spell casting.\n\nCons:\nThe biggest con is the optimization, I have a NVIDIA 3080 RTX with a Intel i7-10700k CPU and experienced around 6 crashes due to 99% cpu usage spikes. These cpu spikes didn't even make sense because I would hover 10-25% cpu usage during a story cutscene and then magically, in the same cutscene, spike to 99% and crash.\n\nFor some reason, Joker's walking speed is nerfed, this is annoying because there's a lot of walking around.\nMore times than in Royal, I felt like my dialogue options didn't matter. There was a time when I picked a dialogue option and I got a response that was more obviously geared towards a specific option that I didn't pick.\n\nThe gameplay quickly became repetitive because bosses had too much HP. Boss fights became 4 minutes cycles of mash combo/magic -> refill sp -> repeat until boss is dead. This got so boring that 3/4 into the game, I changed the difficulty to easy to finish fights faster.\n\nThe game puts an emphasis on playing all the Phantom Thieves equally but there is no \"back-up\" xp to give to the people that are benched. This unfortunately sometimes made me grind xp for 3 people at a time instead of progressing the main story. \n\nThere are annoying side quests. Most quests are \"backtrack to X place and kill Y amount of Z thing\". Sometimes they ask you to kill it with X environmental gimmick. This caused me to backtrack more times than intended because my teammates killed them before I could kill them with X gimmick. There are also stealth side quests that require you to go from point A to point B without getting seen. I dont like stealth missions. These side quests occasionally locked important shop or skill upgrades, making them feel mandatory instead of optional.\n\nThe ambush targeting is awful because your ambush range is not made very clear. Sometimes there isn't cover and you have to quickly run up in knifing range behind an enemy to ambush. Other times you hide behind cover and you can suddenly leap out and ambush in 2x the range. There were even times when I could press the ambush button and ambush an enemy, even though the prompt wasn't there. I also had this incident where Morgana is extra short, so when you crouch behind a window and plan to jump through it to ambush an enemy, he comedically dashes into the wall under the window and breaks the animation instead. \n\nThe game reuses a certain boss. At first, it's cool because it's new, then you fight it again but this time it's holding shields instead of swords. Then after fighting it with shields around 3 times, they make it hold bazookas instead....\n\nThe animations for some of the gameplay are sloppy too. You'd have a character ledge shimmying, but their model isn't even touching the wall they're shimmying on. There was also hiding behind a window but the character model is 7 inches away from the window (this is most noticeable with Morgana's model)\n\nThe velvet room felt unpolished. When registering, you only have the option to \"register all\" else you have to manually register personas 1 by 1. There is only the \"Fuse By Result\" method, the \"Normal Fusion\" method is not present. \"Group Guillotine\" is present but doesn't feel specific and special anymore, you'll see many different Unicorn persona recipes using 3 different personas in each recipe. There are no sorting options when scrolling through the list of personas to summon, it is default sorted by level. \n\nMUSIC:\nPros: The music is great, and the new tracks are decent too.\nCons: A lot of the music is reused from P5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c0acb88495865efb93dd0d3536bf506e", "author": "368dc10a41355fe1a9ba59fbd22d6217", "date": "2025-02-06", "hours": 471, "content": "The game is unplayable because of the PC controls", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4bba03e62ec350b9a71b0a411356597c", "author": "933d997e7d5154c3aa310ceef63274c3", "date": "2025-02-04", "hours": 3456, "content": "Not as good as P5R but still fun and worth playing", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0e7365103326548fb550c6547ef82865", "author": "5e200078c27150b8ad74ee5b3300bbeb", "date": "2025-02-04", "hours": 489, "content": "It's persona of course it's great!", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "809499c0da4653a982d01be66abba271", "author": "91d7dc9e26795642a0c7a5d09709fbe4", "date": "2025-02-02", "hours": 2256, "content": "Honestly, I wasn't sure if  liked it at first.

I played it to the end and had my fun with it. Nevertheless, it's not a game I would necessarily recommend. \r\nLike all titles of this franchice, the story is rather bad, overly in-your-face about saying what it wants to say, too little nuance, spoiling all mayor moments before they happen and so on. The thing is, this games's writing was bad even for a persona game. Especially the majority of enemies are just, in lack of a better word, lame pathetic losers. When you think of people like Kamoshida or Madarame, you think of truely dispicable evil villains who were great at being villains. But in strikers they tried to make them \"relatable\" and in doing so gave them the most pathetic motivations ever. \"I got bullied, so now I'll be evil too.\" \"I'm a bad writer and then I heard someone say that I'm a bad writer! so now I'm evil!\" Naturally the big bad evil is once again the same flavour of nihilism that seeps out of every Japanese media ever. \"If there were no people, then nobody would suffer\". And instead of that notion getting truely challenged, all you hear is \"no, because I have friends\". Only the third boss had a truely interesting premise and motivation, but of course we wouldn't get an actually morally interesting discussion or anything.\r\nObviously the amount of thinking you have to do is 0. Yes, there is a dialogue giving you an explanation of where to go, but why listen to that? everything gets marked on the map. Yes, the dungeons are actually quite cleverly and intecrately designed again, but just like in P5, there is no reason whatsoever to explore or look around how to overcome obstacles. the minimap and NPCs spoil everything. And of course when there are riddles or anything close to that, the NPCs tell you the solution too. \"hey, this door is green. Think we should push the green button to open it?\" yes, even riddles like that get spoiled because you cannot be trusted to think on your own aparently.\r\nMechanically I have to say that I don't really have anything to compare this game against. It's so far the only game of its genre that I have played. I got through quite well, so I would say it's really welcoming to newcomers to its genre and offers a lot of fun there. However I imagine avert players of this genre won't find much enjoyment in it. I played it on hard and despite being new to the genre my experience was what I would describe as normal and even merciless wasn't all that hard. if this is a newcomer's perspective, surely experienced players will find it boringly easy.\r\nSadly most of the time I found my AI controlled teammates to be more of a liability than allies. They die to heavily telegraphed attacks, waste their mana on healing you even if you can drain the element the enemies attack with and so on. In some fights I spent more time trying to prevent the AIs from dieing than actually fighting until I eventually decided soloing the boss was easier.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I wouldn't say it's a bad game. But you only have 24 hours in a day. your day is precious, so fill it with masterpieces instead of games that are jsut \"alright\". nowadays there are enough masterpieces that you don't need to settle for anything less than top.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c34cd71a3121510a97a524e837e58922", "author": "fb2d48a0f7db5666a8232cd76121160d", "date": "2025-02-01", "hours": 12, "content": "On Steam Deck work compatibility with ,,GE-Proton 9-11'' ONLY! \nPlease fix it for normal compatibility!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7cdda5d57e145e869bb5dd74077f0b10", "author": "cefe012e6af15819ac48b5ae2558f2fc", "date": "2025-01-28", "hours": 6136, "content": "Hack and slash type of gameplay. the Story is great.

It's just not quite solid enough to make up for how much of a slog the gameplay is.\r\n\r\nAlso, the game has many technical issues, from random crashes to some cutscenes being jittery, and there doesn't seem to be any way to fully address these issues.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a41099020867541d978bebf142a1b24f", "author": "0d30557d540b58b48b6cb9f5a883bc9a", "date": "2025-01-24", "hours": 2489, "content": "As a sequel to Persona 5, P5 Strikers is a good game, providing a fun, if ultimately inessential, glimpse back into the lives of the Phantom Thieves, giving the player another chance to spend time with them after the mammoth of a game that Persona 5 is. The shift in genre from JRPG to musou is a curious one, but ultimately the format and general template of Persona 5 translates surprisingly well to such a drastically different genre, never feeling all that much out of place. The end result is a game that asks you, in a way, to meet it where it is, and if you can do that, you'll get a lot of value out of it.\n\nI'm not really a musou guy - I've never really seen the appeal, and even after a full playthrough of Strikers, I can't say that I'm a convert to the genre. Keeping that in mind, though, I did have my fun with this game, ultimately, though it definitely offers a learning curve if you've never played a game like this before. It's important not to try and assert your will and your own conception of how to play on the game - let it teach you, work with its systems, and you'll really get the most out of it. Every character feels expertly translated, playing the way you would expect them to play in a real-time combat system, and though the parts of the game outside of its major battlefields are sparse and mostly just to provide short changes of pace, they still feel well-considered for what they are.\n\nStory-wise...well, it's a summer break road trip story, ultimately. I don't think the core narrative is all that gripping or vital, but ultimately, I don't really think that sequels to Persona games need to have deep, evocative stories the way the core games do. What they do need to do instead is provide great character interactions and, frankly, fanservice in spades, and Strikers absolutely delivers on that front. Everyone feels just about pitch-perfect, if reduced a little closer to core traits, and Sophia in particular is an absolute delight of a new character. Zenkichi is fun as well, providing an oppositional force for much of the game while managing to be the butt of most of the game's jokes in the process. Basically, Strikers does a good job of adding flavor without overloading or adding weird traits to its returning cast, and that's really all you can ask of a game like this.\n\nIf Persona 5 is going to get milked to death the way 4 was, then the least Atlus could do is do it right, and do it in a satisfying way, and I think Strikers shows that they're absolutely capable of that. I appreciate the exploration of other genres via these main game spinoffs, and it's clear to me that care is put into making sure these spinoffs don't screw with the appeal of the root games.

The overall vibes of the gang and their journey stayed true to the original; comfy, lo-fi, and of course, the power of friendship. The game has its ups and downs, here are some I noticed as I played:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The story does not beat around the bush. It assumes that the player has played and experienced everything from its prequel. This is good because we don't have to deal with a slog segment such as reintroducing the characters. Sadly, this means that players who have not played Persona 5 will miss out greatly. \r\n- The animations are really smooth and stayed similar to the formula of the prequel. \r\n- About the gameplay. ALL team members have unique skills, movesets, and playstyles which is AMAZING. \r\n- The menu screen is dynamic and exciting\r\n- The auto function in dialogues is very smooth and makes you feel like you're watching an episode with its pacing\r\n- OST is straight up FIRE, in-battle, character themes, boss fights, story scenes, fire all-around.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Some dialogue in the story feels unnatural or forced\r\n- There are some voice lines that are very inaudible (especially Ryuji's) but its only in the first portions of the game\r\n- It is very sad that most of the confidants we met in the prequel (e.g., Iwai, Takemi) are not in this game and the reason for their absence doesn't even make sense. I guess you could argue that this game takes place in a timeline where we didn't max out our confidants in the base game, but still sad nonetheless. \r\n- [spoiler] Sophia's phantom thief name is seriously \"Sophie\". No creativity, but that's just a nitpick [/spoiler]\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a beautifully-made game that stays true to the spirit of its predecessor. Its story and dialogue may not be the same, but for a spin-off game? Its quality is way above average. 8/10!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2e2466b192535d309ae95c832956b74f", "author": "704f317887f95a8f911e8c7430a3f23c", "date": "2025-01-17", "hours": 2099, "content": "You can call ryuji hot 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6794dfdd52d252e8bac605324de63e4a", "author": "27368232c028559e959b286f8c247b65", "date": "2025-01-16", "hours": 6327, "content": "The story is ok. The core is more of the same as what we got in P5 but with new characters, a few twists, and, surprisingly, a couple of P3 references.\nIt looks stylish and the music is nice.\nThe gameplay is not bad. The numbers go up which makes endorphins in your brain go brrr, but there are a few annoying things that make the experience worse.\nFor example, you know how in the previous persona games you had a choice of spending some SP to use skills to kill enemies quicker, or you can conserve SP to use later in the run, but risk being hurt now. Strikers provide you with another option \u2013 use combos which trigger a skill. And it's the first issue. What is the reason to use anything but shortest skill triggering combo? So, most of the move list is barely used.\nAnother strange design. Remember how you had a choice trying to push a bit further but risking losing progress, or ending the run now but you won't be able to return to combat until the next day, which in combination with tasks deadlines could create interesting situations? Forget about it. You can return to the \"real world\" as many times a day as you like. If it's not a limitation anymore, why won't they let a player to just restore HP/SP at checkpoints? It's 3 loading screens and a bunch of menus to get to the real world and back. And even if you don't want to return you can just restart a battle as many times on any difficulty.\nDifficulty is another issue. The game actively discourages playing on hard: it warns you upfront that there\u2019s no reward for it, then repeatedly asks you to switch to normal if you die. Grinding or improving gear feels unnecessary when the game practically begs you to take the easy route. Yeah, some dmc games did that too. You die 3 times, get a notification that an easy difficulty is unlocked, but it happens only once, not every time. Why did they do that?\nProbably, because they knew something is wrong with that. Some side quests are harder than the last battle. I understand final boss should be beatable even if the player didn't finish all the side things but it shouldn't be easier than the first one.\nBosses are boring, with 2 exceptions. There are jails instead of palaces now. And they are repetitive and \"stretched\". Capture 3 towers with mini-bosses, fight the fourth mini-boss, fight the jail boss.\nThere are a few minor things also, like Joker's quick shot automatically aiming at the strongest enemy or something, trying to lock on a specific enemy is pain when there are dozens of them on the screen, the characters clipping through the hiding spots. But the worst thing is, let's say, the performance issue. Check the discussion in the steam community, check the suggested solution, and ask yourself \"why would I buy this game here to get worse experience than someone who got it with 100% discount from an alternative retailer?\".", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "27624301a0355e5ea26bfc72477b1ee8", "author": "ee3d207ff724586a8f035faaf7aad4a3", "date": "2025-01-16", "hours": 2044, "content": "Good sequel to Persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d6c036dde446562ab8925341c3365c3d", "author": "d30ddcc447ad5e74828b013307115457", "date": "2025-01-15", "hours": 2528, "content": "Infinite Black Screen in Jail of the Abyss\nEven when trying the following:\n- Running as administrator (in the .exe properties)\n- Disabling fullscreen (in the .exe properties)\n- Turning off Texture Filtering - Anisotropic Sample Optimization (in the Nvidia Control Panel)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5efb8d5b15505862ba3347955750060f", "author": "bcb227f1e4b85c1787a964456bf24497", "date": "2025-01-15", "hours": 1118, "content": "I thought this game is just another \u201cMusou-like\u201d\n\nBut actual it really PERSONA but ACTION ROG STYLE !!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "aed1cd8118595c98a394c19f7bbed500", "author": "b443874078cf5dd3b69b422a45855ca2", "date": "2025-01-13", "hours": 1150, "content": "DO NOT play this game with a keyboard", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4b77e8bd0e83563c9b61c19eb1e22dd5", "author": "2b0a026db0945579901fa4c8b007b0fe", "date": "2025-01-11", "hours": 2975, "content": "for me i like it the part where i can travel around japan , but i hope i can travel around the world also", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7334aad633405288a89d0ed96c2dc18e", "author": "04be3e5daf02532eb5715509951e1418", "date": "2025-01-10", "hours": 4093, "content": "I really feel like this was a fitting story sequel to Persona 5 with a fresh take on combat for the series.

Persona 5 Strikers (P5S) should be played after playing P5 or P5R, especially if you plan to enter P5 series due to its story and characters.\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nEven though P5S released a year earlier before P5R, P5S story takes place after P5R's normal ending rather than royal or true ending. The overall story is just so-so, where there's little mention of side characters and story from P5. But I'm satisfied with the character relationships, including 2 new side characters with good character development. The villain remains mixed bags though, where I just want to beat them as soon as possible.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nI simply don't like the hack-and-slash combat, it feels crude and unpolished for a game with $60 base price. After trying it a bit, I decided to play on lowest difficulty while cheating the amount of money, so I could buy lots of HP/SP items and spam skills. I also feel annoyed by some gameplay mechanics that are introduced halfway or later during the story.\n\nIt's also worth to mention P5S is less friendly towards casual or story-only players. Unlike P5R, P5S doesn't offer Satefy Difficulty which offers many conveniences such as option to retry if you're defeated and enemy takes longer to spot you. In addition, it doesn't let you summon high-level Persona at the beginning of the game. And just like P5R, P5S doesn't have auto-save feature either.\n\n[h2]Other[/h2]\nIf you use Steam Deck or other Linux devices, P5S probably wouldn't run or run properly without a bit of tweak. By default, P5S probably will only show a black screen, unable to play video cutscene, unable to show phone UI or some of those issues. And since P5S uses Denuvo DRM, it may lock you for 24 hours while you're still trying which Proton version and launch parameters work best for your device. It's one of some cases where DRM punish legit buyers.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nSeeing Phantom Thieves back in action alone makes P5S worth it, although you better grab it during the discount.

If you finished Persona 5 craving more, this is the perfect game to get next. The combat may be different, but it retains the charm the original game had! While the story elements are spot on, there is a few things that I would warn any new player about. First, the game has this really annoying bug where you might get stuck on a black loading screen, so make sure to save your game a lot (especially when exiting the dungeons.) Second, this might be a bit nit-picky or a skill issue, but one of the boss fights is so horribly designed in my opinion. When facing it, I felt that I had to \"cheese\" it in order to beat it. It also isn't balanced around normal game mechanics like the other ones (which I had no problem with those ones.) Despite these complaints, I would still recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Persona 5.

You\u2019ll choose a party of 4 characters and can take direct control of any character. Each member of the Phantom Thieves can perform magical attacks focused on a different type of elemental damage, and the gang\u2019s leader Joker can switch between multiple personas, giving him access to every type of magic.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWhile exploring each dungeon in the metaverse (in Strikers they\u2019re called \u201cjails\u201d instead of \u201cpalaces\u201d, but they\u2019re functionally the same), you\u2019ll have to defeat shadows which take the form of various monsters, each having their own elemental strengths and weaknesses. You can run around the battle arenas using melee attacks to take out weaker enemies, but ideally you\u2019ll want to use magic attacks to target stronger enemies\u2019 weaknesses, making them vulnerable to powerful all out attacks. Most magic attacks can hit multiple enemies, and the action will pause while you select a spell and aim at the desired area.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tI wouldn\u2019t say the combat system is bad, but I personally didn\u2019t really enjoy it. Royal\u2019s turn based system was much better and more tactical. In Strikers, most fights feel really chaotic, with large numbers of enemies and lots of magical effects on screen, making it hard to see what is actually happening, so I felt like the only way I could consistently avoid enemy attacks was to frequently mash the dodge button between my own attacks.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSP management is also a constant problem. Because of the high volume of enemies, you can very easily burn through all of a character\u2019s SP (used to activate magic attacks) in a couple of fights. Meanwhile, bosses have huge health bars, and mini-bosses seem to have infinitely respawning waves of minions. You\u2019ll definitely need to buy as many SP restoring items as possible from shops.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStrikers has less side activities than Royal. Each city you visit is really just a couple of streets with a few shops, and no significant NPCs or side quests. Strikers\u2019 equivalent of side quests mostly involve returning to previously completed jails to kill certain enemy types or collect junk items, to unlock new weapons and upgrades. On the plus side, at least it won\u2019t take forever to complete this game (I mostly enjoyed Royal, but I eventually felt that it was a bit too long and bloated).\r\n\r\n[h1]Story (high quality)[/h1]\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStory is well written, although several of the jails and bosses have similar themes to those found in Royal.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Phantom Thieves, including a couple of new allies, are interesting characters.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tEnglish voice acting is good for the whole cast.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tI strongly recommend playing Royal first, because the story assumes the player is already familiar with who the Phantom Thieves are, how the multiverse works, and other events which took place during the previous game.\r\n\r\n[h1]Technical (high quality)[/h1]\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt took me 42 hours to complete the story.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tI didn\u2019t have any problems with bugs, crashes or framerate.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tControls worked well on my Xbox 360 gamepad.\r\n\r\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\r\n\r\nPersona 5 Strikers is a good game, but because of its strong focus on story, I\u2019d only recommend it to fans of Persona 5 Royal who want another adventure with the Phantom Thieves.

Narrative-wise, it's a smoother experience.; its themes, in my opinion, are a much better fit for the modern sensibilities. It is the Modern Persona (starting from 3) even more modernized.\n\nFor context, the director of Persona 3, 4 and 5 Katsura Hashino left after the completion of 5. There has been a noticeable shift in the games' style from then on. It is not so significant where it ceases to be Persona, and it may even just be a phantom thought perpetuated by confirmation bias. But \"something\" is different. Ideas are grander; characters are more sympathetic and complex. Themes are somewhat more nuanced. I vastly prefer Maruki to Shido, and I enjoyed the characters in Strikers as well as their moral dilemma. However, the details and the atmosphere do not feel as distinct as the three games helmed by the previous director. Sorrow, self-doubt and rage. The details of the story feel less fine-tuned, and while I like the plot, the actual delivery often feels questionable. Not enough to cause any actual complaint, just enough to make me go \"huh, wait a second\" afterwards. But enough blabbering, onto some actual review stuff.\n\nPlot: The themes shift from 5's rather straightforward \"let's go f up some baddies who are stand-ins for somehow actual real-life people (which is more messed up since we don't have a group of highschoolers changing their hearts)\". Striker focuses instead on once well-intention people who have become cruel due to past trauma. So you have actual likable villains with sympathetic motivations. Mr. Zephyrman's theme song counter-strike is honestly so good. But the details don't exactly hold up since said \"becoming twisted\" is part of the villain's design which takes away accountability to a degree (it is revealed that the monarchs were intentionally chosen, and becoming a monarch demonstrably has negative psychological effects. This detracts somewhat from the theme of good people turning bad from trauma.) The game also never goes far enough into the theme for my liking. For example, the main cast acknowledges the enemy's sympathetic motivation and tragic past; they proceed to judge said enemy which is perfectly fine. But they never address the root cause of said trauma - the people who created the toxic environment that made these good men go bad. There is also the other theme of blind reliance on technology/ giving up their desire. This is a repeat of the demigurge story beat in 5 but done not as well since it fails to connect itself to the rest of the story as well. (I love Ichinose as an idea, but she barely does anything. Boo) The plot is more evenly distributed so every character gets their chance to shine at one point.... except Mona? (Yay Haru though) The cast is as enjoyable as they were in 5. So there's that.\n\nThere is a dungeon quality drop-off in the middle where things just don't feel as well designed after the first few dungeons, but it manages to end on a strong note which is good enough for me.\n\nAs for gameplay, I'm surprised a hack-n-slash game managed to incorporate in Persona's feature gameplay mechanics. The start is a bit rough and takes time getting used to, but I can confidently say that this is my favorite musou game alongside Dynasty warriors 2.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9d52e5b9c873561e9e13a54f4aae73b5", "author": "db9af5c504f6570b9f584033b871c3b7", "date": "2024-10-13", "hours": 180, "content": "very cool very swag i like it", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "536a05e2c39a5c908af3237482a56df8", "author": "829e6867b451571c875c7c76c76ccd74", "date": "2024-10-13", "hours": 3377, "content": "An outstanding game and a superb continuation of Persona 5 (Vanilla/Royal).\n\nThis is a HARD game with an extremely steep learning curve.

I have finished the original Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal, with over 400+ hours of playtime for both games. (can you tell that I really love the franchise? lol)\n\nAt first I was hesitant to try it for after reading about that game, it swaps out the traditional turn-based combat for a hack-and-slash gameplay. I was unsure if this change would work, but the transition feels surprisingly seamless. Persona 5 Strikers still retains the strategy elements, allowing you to pause and plan your next moves. \n\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of Persona 5 Strikers is reuniting with the beloved Phantom Thieves. The game picks up after the events of Persona 5, and the story feels like it's really well crafted. The characters are just as vibrant and relatable as before, and the addition of new faces adds fresh energy.\n\nThe visuals! Oh the visuals! I first remembered playing Persona 5 for the first time and I could just look at it all day. Especially the menu screen! Persona 5 Strikers are just as stylish and visually striking as in the original game, with that signature Persona aesthetic still front and center. The design is sleek and intuitive, and the soundtracks are just awesome. It brings a hint of nostalgia, while different, continues to deliver with remixes of iconic tracks alongside new ones that fits the games's more action-packed tone.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic continuation of the Phantom Thieve's journey. I have played for about 10 hours of the game and I'm really loving it! I cannot help but smile while playing this game. (A really huge fan of the game, right?) The game offers an engaging blend of action, strategy, defeating a lot enemies (hack-and-slashed),  and of course a heartfelt story.

It's certainly not perfect like Royal, and unfortunately with some issues in this game I can't help but see it as the inferior version. But if you are able to ignore them, it's still a good game. If you loved the story and characters of this game, I definitely recommend it. But if you enjoyed only the turn based combat, then it won't be for you. It's completely different, but a change is refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe combat is... interesting. I actually didn't like it at first. It felt complicated and overwhelming. I originally thought the battling had little to no strategy but the more I played the more I realized that's wrong and it's not just button smashing. Right after the first Jail is when I started to enjoy the game a lot. Though, embarrassingly, I only really started to learn the combos by the last Jail. I didn't realize there was so much move variety depending on how many times you press Attack before you press Special. I also really enjoy how each Phantom Thief has their own moveset, and speaking of, I love that you can play everyone!\r\n\r\nAll the new characters, both Phantom Thieves and bosses, are really well written. My favorite part of P5R was the social aspect, so I was kind of bummed that social links weren't present in this title, but I enjoyed how they implemented the social aspect in this game too. The most unfortunate part about this is the new Royal characters are missing.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of great characters, the story is really good, as per usual in the Persona series. Some spoilers ahead: [spoiler] I was curious how the Metaverse was going to return, and I enjoy how it was implemented here. [/spoiler] Also, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the characters and their developments are just so good and I really hope we get to see more of them in future P5 titles. ([spoiler] Specifically Zenkichi and Akane!!!! [/spoiler])\r\n\r\nThe new environments are really refreshing, and speaking of(again), I really love the investigation phases before going into the jails. Being able to explore the new areas and talk to all the phantom thieves while they just hang out in the area is awesome. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the jails (again again), It's cool how they take over a whole city, but that makes them less memorable/detailed. My favorite parts was the last couple minutes of the jail, and the boss of each area. Though with some negatives also comes positives... There's a ton to explore and it's kind of just fun to have a sandbox to just mess around in. It's also a GREAT QoL change that you can go in and out of Jails without time passing (the calendar system is basically not important at all) and jails NEVER go away. And you can re-fight the bosses! So awesome. (and forgot to mention, all bosses are really fun.)\r\n\r\nThe new request and bond systems are really nice. The requests feel a lot more unique to the system in Royal. Instead of every single request being tracking and then defeating the enemy in mementos, there's something different to do each time. Whether that is killing an enemy with in a specific way, or getting items for people, it's refreshing. The bond system is also pretty nice. It's almost like the social-link/stat upgrades but you have a little bit more freedom with it. (but I gotta say... the achievement maxing the bond's is quite a grind lol)\r\n\r\nI've already mentioned a couple negatives in my previous paragraphs, but I just want to go over them all now. \r\n-The new engine doesn't feel great when moving around in the overworld. Metaverse feels fine though.\r\n-Voice acting is pretty quiet. Turning down the SFX & music helped. Still disappointing though.\r\n-Anti-Aliasing is basically non-existent and most characters and models look horrendous from far away.\r\n-Lack of Royal characters, story arcs, and QoL changes is disappointing. (Both Royal and Strikers was in development at the same time sadly)\r\n-The game didn't even run on Steam Deck without Proton, and then the cutscenes had no voice acting in it. (Which you can fix by putting GST_PLUGIN_FEATURE_RANK=protonaudioconverterbin:NONE %command% into the launch options.)\r\n-Controls being completely swapped is a minor annoyance, but still,\r\n-And worst of all, barely any patches for this game. I feel most of the stuff I mentioned above is fixable... But only 2 patches since 2021. Really disappointing\r\n\r\nRegardless, even though I just mentioned a TON of negatives compared to my Persona 5 Royal review, I still think this game is good. But I'm unsure if I'd recommend it to everyone like how I recommend Royal. If you enjoy the characters/story then most definitely. It's just such a different game. I know the dev teams that made Royal and Strikers are completely different, but I kind of wish ATLUS gave the Strikers team a bit more time to cook before releasing.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 11, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "15bde48f3af853608907a9078ca08760", "author": "e08ca83cc35c5834a5966afea54274b5", "date": "2024-10-05", "hours": 447, "content": "This game is currently in the Humble Choice for October 2024, and this is part of my coverage of the bundle. If you are interested in the game and it's before November 5th, 2024, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.\n\nIt\u2019s Persona Warriors. \n\nThis game was made by the Persona team, as well as Omega Force, which is better known as Koei Tecmo\u2019s team that does the Dynasty Warriors titles and pretty much all the Musou games, so what is this one? Well, it\u2019s either a Persona game that has combat very similar to Musou titles with large battlefields and tons of enemies, or a Musou game with a lot of RPG elements and non Musou gameplay. \n\nTruthfully, I think the former is correct. This is a Persona game telling more Persona tier stories. You don\u2019t choose a level, instead there\u2019s an obscenely long opening, like every Persona game, and there\u2019s a lot of time spent outside the dungeon. The dating system isn\u2019t here, but this title is still heavily based on Persona 5.\n\nWhich is also potentially a downside. You totally can start here if you want to skip the first game, but there\u2019s a hundred hour game that comes before this that\u2019s a typical JRPG. If you\u2019ve played that and want to see more of those characters, then this exists. But there are, of course, spoilers, even just who is in the cast is likely a spoiler for Persona 5.\n\nPick this up if you want another Persona 5 story, or you just want every Warrior game. I like Persona, but I have this because it\u2019s Omega Force, and I\u2019m very happy with that. It\u2019s not a Dynasty Warriors game, in the same way Hyrule Warriors wasn\u2019t a Dynasty Warriors game, it\u2019s a merging of the two franchises, and that makes it something unique. \n\nAlso, this is like a 40 hour title, so be prepared.

This is a sequel spin-off, but it's not quite the same as P5R, it feels a bit hollow. The main cast is back, and it's great to spend time with them again. Most of the side-characters are not, but since this game covers a road trip summer break, that makes sense and I can live with it. The story is interesting and is the main driving force that keeps me playing, because the combat is not good or fun, at all. \n\n**Edit: I did end up lowering the difficulty and that made the combat much more bearable. The story is essentially a re-tread, but enough is different that I feel it's worth it to play for story alone. \n\nI've seen this game compared to the musou Warriors games, but that is a lie - this game is far more punishing than a Warriors game, even on normal. The average enemies usually aren't too bad, but when there's a lot of them it becomes hard to keep track of what they're all doing. They don't always telegraph their physical moves, and dodging their magical moves can be difficult sometimes due to the damn camera moving the way it wants and not the way I want. It's very easy to keep getting destroyed by named enemies or bosses (who are very spongy), then for some reason things go your way and you succeed - until the next one comes along and repeats the process. Every time I thought I had a handle on the combat, the game proved I hadn't. All your characters can die in seconds before you have time to react. This is annoying, frustrating, and a real fun-killer. \n\nI don't mind difficult games when they're fair, but this game does not feel fair.

However, there are plenty of problems with this title and it really feels like a lower production qualiity product. Which it is, which is fine for a (sequel) spin-off, but it does get in the way of fun sometimes.\r\n\r\nFirst off, there is no time management aspect at all. You're on a set schedule and there is no way to run out of time. If you're facing any difficulty during the game, you can always get back to the car, heal up and get back into the action. If you were looking for the time-limited life-sim gameplay of Persona games, you can turn back now. There are no Social Links, let alone any dating elements. You can do optional Bond scenes which are a far cry from the Confidants.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to the combat can be overwhelming. The game constantly throws new info at you and gives you almost all the playable characters very early on. I recommend taking a time for yourself to play around with available Phantom Thieves, pick your favorites and learn to use them before rushing into the story. However, once you figure out the basics, the game actually does a decent job of incorporating Persona mechanics. You can chill on the Easy difficulty if you just care about the story or beat the game on Hard and then move onto Merciless if you want to test yourself.\r\n\r\nStrikers messes up Persona fusion pretty badly though. The cast of demons is limited, which is understandable, but the actual act of fusing up new demons feels very restricting. Eventually you're going to need to grind up levels of old demons if you want to unlock a new Persona to use. This made engaging with the mechanic a chore, completely unlike the addicting nature of sitting in the Velvet Room and fusing stuff in the original P5.\r\n\r\nThe story feels like a rehash of most of the story beats of Persona 5. While sometimes Strikers uses this as an opportunity to show how the Thieves have matured, a lot of the time the story will just feel like the same thing all over again. Most of the old characters have their moments, especially Haru, who was poorly treated in the original. The new additions to the cast are surprisingly good and feel right at home with the OGs.\r\n\r\nThe game was developed by another studio and used a different engine, which worked well for the action gameplay, but exploration in city areas was sometimes very clunky. Joker could not sprint and navigating familiar areas like Leblanc felt like a cheaper experience. The UI, while definitely stylish, did not feel as smooth to click through. You often had to wait for the animations to play out before being able to move to another window, meanwhile in the original game, you could move through the menus pretty quickly if you remembered your way around the UI.\r\n\r\nLastly, grinding the Bond level is a giant chore. You can either farm the same thing on Merciless, replay the story or use repeatable spots which give small Bond boosts. All of which will bore you eventually. It's decent for mindless playing while listening to a podcast or whatever else you prefer.\r\n\r\nin summary, if you want more Phantom Thieves, get the game on a discount and just beat the story.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 38, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "49361da87dfc53ef8c1a2c6b8db8495a", "author": "2559b6456cb252cd86fa5bed94e78ac1", "date": "2024-08-03", "hours": 1804, "content": "Do yourself a favour and skip this one.

For the most part, Strikers's gameplay is fun, frantic and engaging. It adapts a lot of Persona usual mechanics and gameplay like All-Out Attacks, 1 Mores and Persona skills really well into the hack-n-slash genre. I really did enjoy this game's combat... for the first 10 or so hours. After a while the combat just turns into repeat the same few combos over and over again until all the enemies die. There's barely any challenge and it starts to get really repetitive, especially if you're doing the requests. Another small gripe I have that turned into a pretty big one was that, out of all things that were brought over from the original Persona 5, the game did not bring back sharing EXP from battles with all the benched party members. This leads to nearly all of the characters aside from the three you pick for your party and Joker to be very underleveled, which is a bit of a problem in some bosses, especially the final boss which requires you to use all of the party members for it.\nOther than the gameplay, the story this time is pretty uninteresting. A lot of the story's themes just feel like a retread of the original Persona 5's themes, which I know sounds like a stupid complaint considering this is a spin-off of P5 but other Persona spin-offs like Persona 4 Arena also had similar themes to its original but also added more on top of that. The only other message this game offers other than rebellion is that AI can be used terribly in the wrong hands, which is a nice message but it doesn't really correlate back to or add on top of Persona 5's already existing themes like P4A\nThere is one thing I do really like about this story though and that's interactions and chemistry of the Phantom Thieves. This might be a hot take but I much prefer how the thieves act as a group here than they do in the original. They feel a lot more like an actual group of friends, where as in the original Persona 5 they felt like people who were only friends because of their connections to the Phantom Thieves. It's probably because of this game's more chill setting of a holiday but the characters are able to shine a lot more as friends than they ever did previously.\nI know I've sounded very negative in this review but if you did enjoy Persona 5 and want a follow-up on its story with some faster gameplay then I would definitely recommend this game.

But if the game runs well it is a great experience", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b731d146199751b895cb9510b3bc295c", "author": "b6a9f3a7e55e5f858668832aa4717d1a", "date": "2024-07-26", "hours": 2510, "content": "i'm done playing P5 Scramble: Strikers and it's fucking phemomenal, may be not the best thing (for example Hot Springs Scene, some of the requests, mostly those Phantom Thieves missions) but overall amazing soundtrack, beatiful characters and their personality, amazing dungeons design.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a1f3156a84965b7d8d413393a02c8f52", "author": "97c099221a075da49f1eddeaba65effc", "date": "2024-07-26", "hours": 3382, "content": "Persona 5's Direct to DVD sequel", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 16, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c237e8722cbe54e8855e53220a949016", "author": "bee4658142a7532d9c071b4f8ca8f376", "date": "2024-07-25", "hours": 3203, "content": "makoto niijima", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 39, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74480883150154d08c91572f64402e7d", "author": "7d2c2d0a3f345980a41d603ad6a2625a", "date": "2024-07-24", "hours": 10610, "content": "While I'm not usually a fan of hack-and-slash combat in games, I found this to be quite enjoyable, even though it was pretty difficult at first. I ended up getting all the achievements, which is high praise for a genre I generally dislike.\n\nI love the Persona series, but I approached this game somewhat half-heartedly. As a spin-off of Persona 5, I didn't expect it to offer much beyond some story content. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the game turned out. The fusions have unique mechanics compared to Persona 5, and the game did a great job making hack-and-slash combat enjoyable for me.\n\nThe story was also quite good, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I tried turning the quality and everything else on \"low\" but nothing seems to work. The only thing that worked for me was someone's suggestion online to install \"Process Lasso\". With this, and only this, was I able to play the game normally. \n\n- Game is so repetitive and dull fight wise. This is probably my fault cuz i came into the game expecting it to be something like Dynasty Warriors since I saw the game tagged with \"musou\". So i was like \"WOW, a JRPG and musou, gotta try that\". Welp, no. It didn't do it for me xD\n\n- Most times, the dialogues are boring and just unnecessary, like they talk way too much when there's no need for that.\nAn example:\n-Person X is feeling down-\n-The friend group tries to cheer X up- :\nPerson A: Hey dont't be sad, it'll all turn out well.\nPerson B: Yeah we'll all work together to solve this issue, then you won't have anything to worry about!\nPerson C: Eactly, what Person B said! We shall stick together and never leave you alone in this!\nPerson D: Ohohoho, dont't forget, we're the Phantom Thieves after all. We help all those in need!\nPerson X: Aw you guys ;-;\nPerson E: hehe, cmon cheer up already!\nPerson F: Yeah cheer up!\nPerson G: Cmon X, a smile suits you best!\nPerson X: Thank you guys <3\n-Now Person A to G all start replying one after the other-\nLike literally why does the whole group have to reply on every single thing T_T This made me skip like 75% of the dialogue. and only read main parts and story explanations. Oh, sometimes even the explanation and plan discussions take TOO LONG so i skip that too x). At this point i started not giving a fuck about the story too, sadly, hehe :^)\n\n- The way they set up Achieving the side quests is messy imo and made me feel like it's such a chore..\nand the rewards for them weren't .. rewarding.\n\nPROS: \n- Game brings back personas and skills from Persona 5, so yay. That didn't change when it switched to musou, hack n slash.\n- Makoto.\n- I liked the fact that they move from a city to another. I'm always excited to know which place is next.\n- You can buy ingredients and cook :D\n- Think it had a decent plot twist.\n\nCONCLUSION: \nOf course Steam doesn't have a neutral rating button. It's either a YES or a NO xD and I'm more of an in between here :^)\nIt's not all that bad if you speed run throughout the game like I did xD If you wanna buy it, then do so on sale and never on full price ._.\nBtw, I spent about 35 hours on the game, the rest was afk ops x_x", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0f4867d86846569c89e78a75bbb23d4d", "author": "b84977f728e45b6587bc01095df86da7", "date": "2024-07-15", "hours": 617, "content": "The Changes:\nNo more Turn Based.\nSkill and Item Nerf?\n\nThe Bad:\nCrash so often, I don't remember it crash this ofthen back when 2021 or patch 1.02.\nThe game finished before P5R.

While this game has the \"Dynasty warrior\" gameplay, you only get short fights without territory control mechanics. it's basically an action rpg with heavy emphasis on the hack'n'slash. \r\nWhile a sequel to P5R it is not required to have played the previous game. But it will help to know who's who and what everyone is able to access. Also some plot-related spoiler.\r\n\r\nwhy does it take hours to finish the intro?\r\n...because you get interrupted every 5 second of gameplay. the only time you aren't stopped right in your track while doing something is during cutscene. \r\nI got four separate pop-up window, stopping all gameplay, to tell me I can use a special attack when the enemy is down.\r\nOne for the basic information... cool. thanks. I'll make use of that. \r\nsecond to tell me I can do the same when I down an enemy with an attack... well duh, I pretty much got that from the first one... why not tell me at the same time?\r\nthird to tell me I can do the same when I down the enemy with a status effect.. Couldn't you just include this in either of the previous pop-up or as followup information? no? why wait 5-10 seconds before telling me this. why tell me at all? I thought this was an ACTION game...\r\nFourth to tell me I can do the same when I down the enemy with an attack using their weakness... ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME?! Is this game for children with ADHD so severe they can't read or press buttons?\r\n\r\nThis is just an example. Those four didn't come at the same time. I managed to get half a combo in between each. And to make matters worse, I got ANOTHER pop-up in the NEXT battle saying the same thing, but this time it was to tell me I can down an enemy and look up tutorials to know more. \r\n\r\nThis is a sequel.\r\n\r\nSure, the genre change a lot. Some of the mechanics are pretty different. You can actually do the special attack on ANY downed enemy and it will also hit any enemies near the target.  (NEVER MENTIONNED/SPECIFIED IN ANY OF THOSE STUPID TUTORIAL leaving players of the prequel thinking they might need to down more than one or all of them... one try is enough to know those facts, but I needed four tutorial to know I can do the same attack on ANY kind of downed enemies? After the first one said pretty much that?) \r\n\r\nI am annoyed.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the SAME GAME that throws you in a fight the very moment you start, with no explanation of any kind. Throw the cub down the cliff, dont say anything and leave. Sure, I'm a gamer, I can figure out the very basics on my own. Move, attack, trial and errors style... also the HUD show some buttons so I pressed them to see what it would do. etc. \r\nThat's how the very first fight starts. it's not until you defeated a bunch of enemies that you finally get a clue on what to do.\r\nWith a big fat interruption pop-up. Jump there, do this, go there. Progress, sure...\r\nthen mindless banter and \"press forward\" moments for like 20 minutes. not so bad considering...\r\nYou know... I've had countless DOWNED enemies, Used a lot of special attack on them. Got all out attacks, special animation, weird combo. but it's only 2h in that they give me the pop-up... WHILE TRYING TO INFILTRATE MID-JUMP. ofc I miss the target, it insta-drop me as the one ambushed.\r\nthen interrupt after my first hit (nothing got downed). ok, got it, do the same as I did so far. good talk tutorial. I get a few hits in, the second oen pops up. go away, I don't care anymore. i kill a few enemies. another pop up. and then another mid-combo.\r\n\r\nyou know what kind of tutorial pisses me off the most? THAT KIND. Don't interrupt gameplay, dont force a pause in the middle of the action. don't take away my focus. I almost finished the first chapter or whatever and I still have not had a full fight without pop-up interruption. story or progress-related ones are fine, but those pop-ups are a plague.\r\n\r\nScrew this. I shouldn't have bought this even if it was 70% sale. it's not fun.\r\nLoved the prequel, this sequel is stupid. bypass any logic previously established. Two of the character have different voices. Ann looks like a beach bimbo rather than a student and/or fashion model. Social is BOUGHT, levels are BOUGHT. Velvet room is cruelly lacking (the attendant is a cutie but that alone is not enough). \r\nAs for the plot... you are immediately pointed at BEFORE you even get into town for some similar-looking crime as before. I know Japan IS ACTUALLY THAT DUMB when it comes to accusations and believing said accusations, but come on... So go play with the obviously deranged pastel-colored queen-wannabe and the two obviously swapped AI. Can't say more than that as I've yet to progress further. Most is actually speculations but whatever. Getting a tutorial pop-up to tell me how to fucking press a button 2 hours in when I've been doing that nonstop since the start is hella dumb and annoying.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b86e0f47a5055dc68502182a800f9a30", "author": "6d611da963b15a00b9b3ccafb9fa791c", "date": "2024-06-16", "hours": 886, "content": "I hoped for story similar to P5 but was left utterly left behind.

Those explectations were not met, but I would say I still had an enjoyable time. First off, every aspect of this game that replaces a mechanic in P5R is worse. I was not a fan of the combat in the game. Fights on higher difficulties are a slog to get through due to the amount of health enemies have. Changing it to easy definitely made me enjoy it more since I could easily kill enemies. If enemies had even less health and it played like Vampire Survivors, I think I could've enjoyed the combat. Easy difficulty got me close, but not close enough. There are no confidants in this, instead there is the bond system. While the bond system isn't bad, it is nowhere near as good as the confidants' system. The Jails felt less varied in mechanics than the Palaces, which was a bummer. I believe the jails also had fewer sneaking opportunities than P5R and forced you into a lot more fights, but I may be misremembering P5R. Even though all of these aspects are worse than P5R, they aren't bad either. Once I changed it to easy, I had a fairly neutral time interacting with these mechanics, not good or bad. But, the reason I still quite enjoyed this game is because of the characters and writing. I love the Phantom Thieves so much and getting to see them again was great. Their character interactions and scenes of them hanging out were all very enjoyable. I also really like the new characters introduced, I love Sophia so much and Zenkichi is also great, they really feel like they fit in with the rest of the Phantom Thieves. I also really like Akane, and Konoe was easily my favorite villain. Overall, even though I didn't enjoy the gameplay that much, the characters and writing made this game an overall net-positive experience. Still not sure if it's worth the $40 I bought it for, but it was great reuniting with the Phantom Thieves, 7.5/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4a167ef7098c52ad977ea322e1a73e97", "author": "060392338f3b5372969c98de374e5215", "date": "2024-06-10", "hours": 2308, "content": "Boring fetch quest simulator\n\nThe initial impressions were awesome, the gameplay felt fresh, the story seemed like there was something interesting, etc.\nThis feeling will fade within the 10 hours, after 20 you're just bored.\nI like the story of P5R, but i was just uninterested into the story after the second boss.\nEvery castle feels the same, collect 3 things, fight Boss, \"yeah we did it gang\", that's it.\nThe Port is also really fucking shit, the games system demands are way to fucking high for it too look worse than P5R.\nI didn't play through it, but i looked up the end boss, outta curiosity and really?

The game is neat itself but you have to do so much to achieve meh performance. The game is very poorly optimized. I'm running a 3060 12gb w/ i7 and 16gb of RAM with the game on an SSD and I'm lucky if I can reach the 60fps lock. At least, I used to be until I downloaded Process Lasso and did some other tweaks which brought me to a semi consistent 60. Still though, before I did that, I was getting maybe 20fps. Like playing GTA Online in a full lobby on an original PS4 that's never been dusted. This game will make your computer beg for mercy. Not really, but it'll at least seem like it.\r\n\r\nAnd because of all that, I can't recommend the game. I only recommend working games. This works less than 7 Days to Die walking alongside a pond with water FX turned all the way up. This game is like trying to play R6 Siege w/o the latest drivers, or like trying to launch any Ubi game that isn't compatible with the newer Uplay. It's like trying to play the launch release of Fallout 4 w/o any patches, minus the hard crashes. You won't crash when playing this game but you will soft lock if you try to load the 5th boss fight. Isn't that neat?\r\n\r\nThis game's resolution always looks bad, too. I can't really tell what's wrong with it but the menus always tend to look like they're a quarter of the resolution they should be. Looking at the menus is similar to trying to read a book through a glass jar.\r\n\r\nIf that game goes on sale for $5, go for it. It's still a pretty cool game.

It feels much lower budget than Persona 5 itself, but stays so close to the uber-polished presentation style that you almost don't notice it. The writing overall is a little... off or cheap feeling, but the writing of the main characters is so incredibly on-point that it really won't bother you.

Persona 5 Strikers is not a top tier Dynasty Warriors-style game, or hack and slash game, the story takes criminally long to become interesting, and the writing is significantly worse than the main series games.

One of the \"I wish steam reviews had a \"meh\" option\".\n\nThe story acts as a direct sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) so the characters are all there and are as great as before. Unfortunately everything else about the game is lesser in every way. \n\nThe world is a lot more linear with the slice of life aspect being almost completely absent, the combat is a nice change IMO but best played on easy so enemy health and damage work well with enemy density (any difficult above the lowest turns even basic mobs into damage sponges and powerhouses), the story is \"what if Persona 5, but again?\" but held up well by characters both new and returning. \n\nIt's these cons that make it very difficult to get into nearly as much as Persona 5 which is required reading if you want to get what's happening in the plot.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4acc9b8db6115774ae6c14ad95a61889", "author": "45c7550794565e92bb6e1be13b3cecf3", "date": "2024-04-03", "hours": 1461, "content": "THE STORY IS A SEQUEL TO P5's MAIN STORY, PLAY P5 OR P5R BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS.\n\nIt's pretty fun, story feels like a legitimate sequel to P5 main story instead of how most Persona spinoffs work outside of the Arena games (kind of) and it is canon to P5's story as a whole so it's not pointless like PQ's story. Keep in mind it is a Dynasty Warrior styled game, I feel it is more Persona than Dynasty Warriors, but just keep in mind that if you don't like Warriors games you probably won't like this game. Story is good and fun, music is great as per usual, the new characters are great, specifically like Zenkichi, hope Persona games have more characters like him in the future.\n\nMerciless difficulty is more similar to something like Ultimate Vault Hunter mode from Borderlands 2 than it is to Merciless from P5 or something like Maniac mode from P3P (though it is closer to Maniac than P5 Merciless). It's very much a mode where you test not only your endgame Persona builds, but also just your general understanding of the combat, it is not for everyone and it is also NOT a requirement outside of only starting it for an achievement. I saw someone else review the game negatively purely because of Merciless mode and I don't think that's fair at all, as Merciless is purely an endgame challenge mode for players who want the challenge, you can also just do a regular NG+ without Merciless mode difficulty.\n\nOverall it's a fun game.

Having multiple ways to fuse, item fusing and generally how its laid out. The jails themselves while being fun I feel are a little too short in the game. Personally I would prefer the game having a run time of about 50/60 hours without doing a completion run just to fill it out more. A little more interaction with the characters as well would be nice, having maybe a 1 to 5 confidant level for your group to hang out with them and learn some new tactics or something. Having the new tactics learnt by playing those specific characters in game just seems a little cheap. Also the controls for the game are not that great and to get a playable control setting for yourself does require quite a bit of fiddling.\n\nPersonal Nitpick - I would love if in P5 if you romanced one of your teammates they remember it in game and there is some story too it there. It feels like a huge miss for the folks that romanced Ann for example and then she makes no mention or interaction whatsoever about it with the player. \n\nAll in all though the game is great and I do recommend it to people, but if your wanting a more  normal persona experience either play Persona 5 Royal or new game plus. 7.5/10 would be my rating for this.\n\n(Also not enough time with Coffee Dad)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d17b69153a7e51a4bd0cd5d30a0123ea", "author": "d35922a92eab505691b3890753dbaf80", "date": "2024-03-12", "hours": 3563, "content": "If you expect a quick spin off of Persona 5 , you are wrong.

In fact I enjoyed most of my time with it, but it also feels kinda out of place in an RPG series. It's blatantly a Dynasty Warriors clone that takes place in the Persona universe with RPG elements shoved in to make it feel more at home. As such, fans of that series are going to love this, I'll wager. I'm not one of them, and if anything my holdups felt like reasons I wouldn't enjoy that series.\n\nBut that said it is a very focused experience which (again, unlike most RPGs) will not give you any chance to explore much outside the path the story gives you (which as I think about it is quite ironic considering the themes of the series and this game in it in particular), so if you are the kind of player who gets lost in side stories and never actually finishes the game despite wanting to see it through, this is probably for you. In addition, this game is about as true to the Persona 5 experience without remaining the same game as is possible due to it's presentation, so fans who wanted to visit Joker and his friends again will also get exactly what they wanted out of it.\n\nIf there is anyone who should avoid this game, it's ironically the people who came here wanting an actual RPG experience. That is not what this is despite the series, and furnishings of it included. So if that's what you want, you will likely find what you are looking for starkly missing. \n\nOh and unless it's a cheap way to get the background music from the rest of the series into battles, SKIP the deluxe edition.

I can admit it is a bit button-mashy, in that the optimal way to deal with enemies is to farm for 20 hours and simply spam their weakness, but you really don't need to play this way. \n\nDishing out a few combos, perfect parrying the boss, baton passing all around and executing even more combos with characters who play totally differently, obliterating everything with a Showtime attack, using the environment objects, getting actual helpful helping help from Oracle to remember how to hit technicals, taking advantage of stagger windows and long windups to do longer combos which then deal a crit, which leads to an All-out-attack, which charges everybody's Showtimes up again and... and...  It's all so well thought out and it very cleverly combines Persona's style with a real-time combat system. \n\n[spoiler] It's not perfect, of course; SP drain encourages you to leave and instantly re-enter to refill it after each combat at the cost of real life time spent in a loading screen and nothing else. [/spoiler]\n\nNow, one of the side effects of combining Persona with not-Persona is that, despite it being possible for the player to no-hit every fight (every enemy has immaculately telegraphed attacks and it's brilliant), you're still fighting with a team. If you neglect your team's armor, or their level, or try to go up against end-game opponents early on, they just get annihilated, leaving you with <1/4 of your DPS, and you need that DPS, unless you're down for a 30+ minute solo fight. Strikers is [i]hard[/i], and if you play [i]on hard[/i], every big enemy is a tank, and they hit like one. So, you still need to go through all the preparations that you're used to from Persona to be up to par for a fight, and you also need to be good enough at the combat to win. I kind of hated this at first, but I also hated Persona 5 for this at first, so it makes perfect sense.\n\nRight, onto everything else, in no particular order:\nThe time management and social stuff is much less of a focus (Like, almost not a focus at all)\nThe characters and their dialogue are what you'd expect, except one that was neglected in P5 is greatly improved\nThe music is bonkers. Outstanding. Insanely good.\nThe non-Palaces are less interesting (I didn't find them interesting previously, so no big deal for me)\nMenuing can be a bit sluggish (Still looks cool, though)\nVisual clutter during big battles can be a problem\nLiterally zero performance issues...?

There is not a day that goes by that I do not think of P5, and if I do, it is because I do not have the cognitive function to even know where I am. Because of this, I was extremely skeptical of this game. Sequels, as many know, tend to drop the ball and have it shatter into thousands of tiny pieces for things like this. Not all the time, but a definite handful of times. This game is weird with how it handles that ball. Characters and story? Spit-shined at every moment so when you take a look at it, there is always a cartoonish sparkle to it. Gameplay? It has some scratches that seem a bit too deep to buff out.\n\nIf you are like me, then you can understand a game's value by it's price tag. Ignoring gems that should cost more, or ones that should be less than they are worth, quality and price still have a slight tendency to go hand in hand. For what I am about to say, put yourself in the mind of yourself when you are 10 years old, you go to the game store to buy a game, and box art and price is all you have to go off of. \n\nThis game should be worth $40. I know that is so much words for such a weird way to put this, but for the people who understand what I am saying, will have a brainblast when buying this game and understanding exactly, TO A T, what I mean. \n\nSo, enough of this useless obscure gaming blog rambling, here are my thoughts straight up ***NO SPOILERS***\n\n***IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PLAYING***\n\n     Time does NOT progress unless the story says so. You can leave and re-enter jails (this game's palaces, theres a good reason for the name change) at any time. Hanging out with friends also takes up no in game time. \n     You have all the time in the world to finish requests up until the VERY end of the game. Even then, when you finish the game and save, you have a post-clear game that is not new game +, but you have to playthrough to get NG+. It sends you back riiiiight before the last fight with some new requests\n     Persona fusion is WHACK. Don't expect what you get from Persona 5.\n     There is NO EXP SHARE. You gotta have each character in your party if you want them to level up. \n     There are no confidants/social links in this game. It's replaced with a BOND meter that fills up over time in the story, by cooking food, hanging out with friends, and fighting. its not at all, and the way its used is honestly awesome\n\n***THE BAD, AND ANNOYING***\nTo start with the bad, this game's gameplay loop is repetitive most of the time. It is enough to cause it to genuinely becoming grating over time. A bell curve is pretty much the best way for me to explain how this game feels to play. Of course, this is the nature of hack and slash games, but still. It does a lot very well with the hand it is given, though it can get annoying at times. \n\nCharacter balance is a mess. You will primarily have the same-ish team for most of the game, because the other characters are just mediocre at best. Imagine 3 teammates as Persona 5 Royal makoto, the rest as Persona 5 Royal's Morgana. 3 teammates are literally busted. you will feel it, the most busted one is one that i can only describe as legitimately, no DLC end game persona 5 royal Joker. genuinely insane skills + heat riser + debilitate + enduring soul + a collection of damaging skills that is BONKERS and genuinely should not be on one character. Theyre a character that is what feels like end game P5R akechi should have been. \n\nThe fusion system is bad. Some personas you need to level up other personas to ABSURD levels in order to fuse them. King Frost is one of them, requiring a level 40 Pyro Jack and Level 40 Jack Frost (both of which are no where close to that level) in order to fuse. I'm too lazy to go back and reword this whole part of the review to add in how the fusion system works. But its just you choosing from a list, not you choosing a persona and which to fuse it with. Its gross.\n\nThere are plenty more bad things in this game to be aware of, but it is 12:48 am on a school night, I have a show in the morning and frankly, i just want to explain what makes me happy about this game. \n\n***THE GOOD, THE GREAT, AND THE FANTASTIC***\n\nIf you skipped to this part of the review, then hell yeah. i gotchu, i know what you want and ill give you it.\n\nWhen I tell you how this game handles characters is phenomenal, i mean it. if you can believe it, the characters in this game have so much more personality than Persona 5. It feels like a real group of friends. By repeated mentions of in-jokes that dont just feel like \"haha look fans! remember this funny reference! love us for the fact that we are faithful to the source material!\". And additions of new on-going bits and jokes, this game genuinely is what Persona 5 fans needed for the continuation of this story. The voice acting is SO good (for the old cast, im not a fan of 2 of the new characters' voices until the very end of the game). While on the topic of this, I would love to bring up the fact that while the persona 5 anime is not great, the voice acting is terrific. ESPECIALLY Ryuji. The delivery of jokes could not have been better and were done perfectly every single time. You could feel the raw energy and power in the scenes you needed to feel that. \n\nThe best way I can describe this game's characters is like it feels as though is it just one really damn big improv session with the voice actors. To the people who get what I am saying and know how real those feel: yeah. I know what I am saying and I am telling you it feels just like that. There has never been a game that has caused me to laugh out loud by the jokes. There has never been a game where I scream at my screen for a character to do something, and they do it, and have me flip out. There has never been a game that could get me to genuinely feel something even with the most cheesy of lines. This game is phenomenal in all of those regards, and my mom could probably testify that this is the only game ive ever played that has had me this excited and vocal. \n\nNow shifting down a gear to say something that I like but not as much, the story is good! its really enjoyable, and the game is predictable enough for you to know where it'll go soon, but just a bit unpredictable to have you still be excited and have a lot of fun and have you being like \"wait what?!?!\" in so many places. Its the prefect blend of predictability that causes you to feel smart for piecing things together while also not feeling like when you do so you are an adult destroying the questions in Dora the Explorer. \n\nWhat I like about this game is that since Morgana is now new to this to, you actually get to theorize WITH the characters, instead of having a question that you have IMMEDIATELY answered. There is another exposition mule in this game though, like how Morgana was in Persona 5, but it is not nearly the same. They come in just when you need it or whenever you need something to push you to getting more clues.\n\nDidnt know there was a character limit to steam reviews, so lets rap it up.\n\n(one quick thing before TL;DR 2, the music isnt as good as persona 5. its generic action game music with a hint of persona 5)\n\nTL;DR 2: This game is a love letter to Persona 5. This game also gets annoying to play, then it gets bearable, then enjoyable. It is worth the frustration and annoyance. Buy this game only when its on sale, however. anything above $40 is too much for this game.\n\nThank you so much for reading this review.

The pacing, it's kind of slow. It goes from exciting to then you eat a meal, then exciting, then you do this. There is no countdown of days to the end of a palace and feels like it is dragging out towards the end.\n\n2. The gameplay. This is not a fun game. This isn't like other Musou games where the enemies are all on screen, this game has enemies spawn after you approach a shadow. This means you have to start and stop combat constantly which can get annoying.\n\n3. The combat is stiff feeling. Doesn't have a satisfying feel like most other hack and slashes. Dynasty warriors has a better feel than this game. In a turn based RPG, you'd normally plan each move strategically, in this game is basically an attack spam fest of weaknesses with some dodging.\n\n4. Getting upgrades is a pain in the ass since you have to revisit other dungeons and move around them.\n\n5. The game has a cutscene around every corner. This isn't like the original game where an action causes a cutscene, or it occurs in important parts in dungeons. This cutscene often happens randomly, you never know how long they are and watching a shadow morph into some demon every few seconds is annoying after a dozen or so times.\n\nWith that said. I still do recommend this game if you can deal with the shortcomings on design.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a65527800c095d25a0772487978c513e", "author": "e9badeac3a395a4d8559160f98687b27", "date": "2024-02-21", "hours": 1887, "content": "Only if you're a big Persona 5 fan. \nThe combat is ok, the story is allright so far and the characters are the same fun crew from P5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9c0b16023c0a5753a66e4d4c95790445", "author": "c31d60f210e15bbdb0a557c1786be890", "date": "2024-02-21", "hours": 3389, "content": "You get to play Dynasty Warrior Style games with Persona. what else do you want?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7e8ba138d6a75dda8c863ce2c98d2f12", "author": "9b27e5ebedb25aceb2a7c4b6d540e123", "date": "2024-02-20", "hours": 1632, "content": "Using Zio ingame uses Real Electricity IRL", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "07069b9bd4235cf980306b90fb1057e4", "author": "b4b8abf4063a5870b0971e948f58eb02", "date": "2024-02-20", "hours": 3633, "content": "never wrote a review for this so guess I will now. honestly a nice extra chapter into post game persona 5, that also introduces two great party members (I hope they are referenced again some day!). little disappointing it doesn't reference royal content and has its weaker moments, but is still a nice addition to the side persona games out there.

Instead, the authentic and unaltered journey offered by the original \"Persona 5\" sets the perfect stage for what \"Strikers\" has in store.\n\nHaving journeyed through \"Persona 5 Royal\" myself, transitioning to \"Strikers\" felt somewhat jarring. The expectation to continue the enriched narrative of \"Royal\" made the shift to \"Strikers,\" which follows the original's storyline, feel disjointed. This experience highlighted the unique narrative paths of each game and the importance of aligning with the original \"Persona 5\" narrative to fully appreciate \"Strikers.\"\n\nDespite this initial dissonance, \"Strikers\" captivated me with its compelling story and engaging gameplay, embodying the spirit of the \"Persona\" series. It invoked a sense of nostalgia and a desire to revisit the original \"Persona 5,\" not just as a return to its roots but as a way to bridge my experiences between the original game and \"Strikers.\" This revisit isn't about recapturing the unfamiliar but rekindling the familiar and deepening the connection to the \"Persona\" universe.\n\nThe presence of \"Persona 5 Royal\" on Steam, with its enhanced gameplay and narrative depth, makes the idea of going back to the original \"Persona 5\" seem less appealing, especially considering the hardware switch back to the PS4. Yet, the narrative continuity and the charm of the original game hold a special place that \"Royal\" can't entirely replace, particularly for those of us looking to complete the journey into \"Strikers.\"\n\nIn conclusion, \"Persona 5 Strikers\" offers a rich and rewarding experience for those who have traversed the world of \"Persona 5.\" While \"Royal\" presents a polished and expanded version of this world, the unique storyline of \"Strikers\" calls for a reunion with the original narrative. This game is a testament to the enduring allure of the \"Persona\" series, inviting veterans to re-engage with the past to fully embrace the present.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3ed138ac2f9c55ef825766c64069e724", "author": "e7ad4243c97e57a689eae8cb9c5e441f", "date": "2024-02-01", "hours": 3873, "content": "game did feel repetitive at some points, just go into the jail, find 3 things and fight the monarch. despite it being repetitive its still an amazing experience. nice to see the persona 5 characters getting back together. strikers imo is heavily carried by the characters and the interactions they have with each other. solid 7/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ee77435da7f354039a859fa9cc106663", "author": "5799bc099cf95674a691eb99e374452a", "date": "2024-01-31", "hours": 3579, "content": "Enjoyed it, ryuji says fuck, the learning curve for combat is a fucking 90 degree cliff", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c43f0409f92754acbd4c1837f41da821", "author": "20a68bd07d7d50198b2da81c8dc2b830", "date": "2024-01-31", "hours": 2925, "content": "To the point\n==================\nA stylish Musou style game that Persona 5 fans will love, but others might not know what they're buying\n\nGood Stuff\n==================\n++ Cleared on Hard Mode ++\n\n- I'm a fan of JRPGs who played P5 a long time ago and I can confirm that the story here, which is a canonical continuation, is great. Feels like a natural evolution of the already strong narrative and it was nice to catch up with familiar characters.\n\n- The game really incentivizes you to keep your team rotated by changing up the vulnerabilities per dungeon\n\n- Without the timing system from the first game, you can be a lot more leisurely with going into and out of dungeons to explore and level up without worrying about missing things\n\n- The soundtrack is really great, most of the classic tracks from P5 have been remixed and match the more frantic pace of the game.\n\n- Battles are just quick enough where they're fun to grind and try out new strategies.\n\nBad Stuff\n================\n\n- If you do NOT like or have a low tolerance for Weeb stuff, pass on this one cause it hits every trope\n\n- So this was initially pitched to me by a friend as a Musou or a dynasty warriors style game. It is absolutely not. It's more or less an action game with an explorable map. For me this didn't hinder my enjoyment but if you came here looking for a Musou style game you'll be disappointed.\n\n- Normal is incredibly easy, as in you can let you AI teammates do a lot of the work while you hang out. Hard is very punishing in the first dungeon but evens out later, just keep in mind even with grinding you'll be getting 3-4 shot through a majority of the game.\n\n- The bosses, which are the centerpieces of games like these normally, are kind of sad here. They look interesting enough but you're given lots of tricks to defeat them (that you can choose not to use of course). There are a large majority of elite enemy encounters that are much harder.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "97388aa585255078b7d5efbcfc29e969", "author": "a353711c5f6452e4ab9f7b6f360e2c30", "date": "2024-01-30", "hours": 259, "content": "MAn de verdad que ser un pc gamer es la verdadera manera de hacer gameing\n\nEl juego:\n\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "971b9756ac015044a91bb7bdbb466c65", "author": "4e8b84ac155c520f8e70358865132760", "date": "2024-01-30", "hours": 3427, "content": "Much more linear than Persona 5 Royal, but it is a direct sequel and everything else that makes Persona good.

Joker is the weakest of all the team, which is a problem since you can't bench him, and while fights are generally fun, some are really tedious, bosses being difficult only because they are damage sponges and have millions of hp. This gets compounded in merciless difficulty with mobs being able to one shot your team with a single ability. Did not and will not try to grind anything in this game or complete merciless, unlike in persona 5. \n\nAlso, there's really no choice in interacting with your team, other than 3 or 4 events where you choose to hang out with  one of them and get a cutscene.

its currently playing Persona 5 royal together with a buddy\nthis is everything but a spin-off\n\nIt actually does the opposite of what you expect from a spin-off, it enriches the cast while making the new characters just as equally interesting and enjoyable,BUT I AM SO SAD I WILL NEVER SEE ZENKICHI IN ROYAL :(\n+1 favorite character to my book alongisde Yusuke and Ryuji (THE BOYS!)\n\nSophia story as a AI gave me (for the lack of better word in my vocabulary) new light on how i see AI in real world and giving AI atleast the benefit of the doubt despite how its being used in today's world\nnot gonna lie, her speech gave me tears (don't wanna spoil so i will say its the speech she gives when in \"mementos\")\n\nIchinose while you could say was lacking screentime in the early game even after she's been introduced, the end of the game really expanded more her reasoning and personality, made me like her alot more, also sad i won't be seeing her in Royal...\n\nOh,i forgot about to talk about gameplay...uh....\n\nfor joker i sticked with arsene to the end as best i could, after the twins/[spoiler]Lavenza[/spoiler] opened the option to level up your personas and their individual starts, i never bothered to level up other personas BUT arsene, yes i had other personas for either buffs or magic abilities that i would need, but priority number 1 persona was arsene and arsene only\nHow i built arsene was to be flexible\n1 gun skill\n1 melee skill\n1 Ailment skill (preferably sleep)\n1 Buff/debuff skill\n3 passives (1 to nullify his ice weakness)\nand i had no problem with this setup\n\n\nI had no problem, in the begginign i was overwhelmed by the amount of different movesets and playstile each characters had, Morgana and Haru are extremely strong when it comes to technical attacks, too me over half the game to understand how strong their technical attacks were, so for morgana i always tried to have either Ann or Joker with a fire persona to burn the shadows (Sleeps also works too, ironic)\n\nSkull,Fox,[spoiler] Wolf [/spoiler] and Noir are like your melee/gun damage thugs\n\nFox more about Combos that last for almost forever and countering attacks while also dishing alot of strong criticals, if there was a boss-shadow that none of your current thieves could deal with effectively, Fox Constant active damage thanks to his Counter-mid combo always ensured you could keep attacking so long you timed your counters and combo counters\nand if shadow does not have any weakness, just crit it to the ground!\n\nSkull is the most likely the \"Bruiser\" of the thieves as he has the highest burst damage on charged attacks while also boosting the highest base defense,or endurance in this case, Flinching being non existant with his personal buff (Not the \"charge\" ability, although it just makes him even more absurd in burst damage)\n\nNoir is kind of odd, she has acess to both Technical damage and gun damage, while also having both PSY, Ailments and Gun boosts, i still haven't cracked down her playstyle, but i can say from the time i played with her she is indeed very strong with both PSY, ailemnts and Gun attacks, she definitly shouldn't be played with endurance in mind, shes can't really take a punch like the guys (Morgana even less so, but balances out by having the highest agility to dodge attacks)\n\n[spoiler] Wolf is a \"high risk-high reward\" playstyle with his Fury mode, atleast before he unlocks a art that reduces the HP-draining during fury, His attacks are always wide swings that have higher chance of dealing critical damage, not to mention his persona is almigthy based with some Melee and gun skills, focusing on buffing himself and landing criticals to keep the refreshing his current buffs, goes very well with his \"Heat riser\" ability he learns later on, if you wanted to destroy a boss-like shadow, wolf is your man, also can i say his outfit alongside the awakened of choice are FREAKING AWESOME?, A CLAYMORE?!, I LOVE YOU! [/spoiler]\n\nPhanter,Mona,sophie and Queen were the \"supports\" of the thieves, Ann less so since she is much more focused on FIre damage with a twinkle of healing sprayed\n\ni honestly haven't cracked down Queen playstyle yet, but i can say her buffs and healing were very helpful, alongisde her easy to access Combos with innate Nuke affinity, think of her as a \"Spellsword\" or \"Battlemage\" of the thieves, also just as durable as skull\n\nIf SKull is the Thugh, Phanter is the Wizard, being able to apply burning by either basic attacks or persona abilities really goes well with Queen and Morgana for Technical damage, while also having atleast some small way of recovering SP unlike the other Thieves that canno't recover SP unless you use Items or support from Oracle\n\nMona has the highest Technical damage and the best \"oh shit everything is going wrong!\" healing ability by about level 70\nReviving, healing to full, cleansing ailments all in one package for when shit goes wrong, mona pairs very well with fire or sleep de-buffed enemy, as sleeping enemies can be technical hitted from everything they are not immune to\n\nSophie is likely the best healer all around, but she lacked the means to revive teammates, to be frank, i din't play enough sophie yet to be good enough with her combo game, but i was not ignoring her gimmick of catching her yo-yos mid combo (not counting the times i had her in my party as AI, she was very useful, ALSO THOSE THIGHTS)\n\nAilments, unlike Persona 5 royal and original, CAN affect bosses (except the last boss) and makes them VERY strong\nHaru being able to FEAR a friggin Dire shadow is HUMONGOUS of a help, you do however need to get the bond skills to trigger more realibly, alongside some luck boost\n\nby level 5 in ailment rate trigger chance, you will trigger ailments 100% of the time, no exceptions, and its kind of nuts how strong a 10-12 sp cost ailments can be since they affect not just 1 enemy\n\nI'm gonna finish this by saying this: i also loved the gimmick on the last boss fight, TAG TEAM WITH SKULL AND JOKER NEVER FELT SO SATISFYING AND CINEMATIC", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "066198184ceb5ac1b4aede03ab3f5ac0", "author": "e180c86b75ef562e86a700de07ab9b2a", "date": "2024-01-21", "hours": 6613, "content": "Strikers is a really fun sequal to Persona 5.

The overall gameplay sets you off in exploring huge areas called Jails, which are the equivalent to Persona 5's Palaces but with its own set of rules. There is more emphasis on counter-dodge, baton passes, and elemental switching in combat. This makes battle exciting and keeps you on your toes, rather than the usual hack-and-slash that are seen in many Koei titles. Essentially, enemies will knock you down hard on mindless button mashing.\n\nMusic is a big part of enjoying Persona 5, and Strikers did a great job in not only arranging the base Persona 5 tracks, but also has outstanding original vocal tracks of their own. It very much fits the style of Striker's gameplay and enhances them.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Striker's is a great spin-off to Persona 5 Royale.

You can play this like a musou game, but the most efficient strategy is to spam Persona skills to take advantage of weaknesses, technicals, etc. And even if you're not doing that and decide to play it like a musou game like I did, you still need to bring in other characters to maintain buffs and debuffs, or else combat just takes so much longer without being more fun.\n\nYou also need to actually buy gear for your characters (and it's [i]really[/i] expensive to buy that stuff!) so you're basically committed to using 1-2 characters at the start of each dungeon, which actively discourages you to try out other characters. It's especially bad for Joker whose viability is based on how much you're willing to fuse Personas for him. It was a fun thing in Persona 5, it was [b]not[/b] fun in this game!\n\nOverall, still a lot of fun despite all my gripes.

My only complaint with the fights are that it can feel clunky at times with limited movement during combos and the camera movement does not help either. Have not finished it yet, and I don't know if I will, but I still recommend it if you love the world of persona and it's themes. 6.5/10, not worth the full price, would wait for a generous sale to buy this one.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bff559a578d85fcf9b1b9c3d5219e3a5", "author": "073dac9799da5134bcf66c8deae4d79d", "date": "2024-01-11", "hours": 1165, "content": "*I have not beaten the game*\nThis is like the halo ODST of Persona 5, but even ODST has more worthwhile content than this game.

Every world is pretty formulaic, but the story is serviceable with it taking the experiences from Persona 5 and having the characters relate to the villains through their own shortcomings. The combat is the biggest difference in this game and at first it feels a lot better than Persona 5's combat, but after a while it can get pretty stale and even sluggish at times if you don't have the right team comp.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like this game, but the story sucked me in and it carried me to the finish line. The gameplay was pretty fun too.\nFirst off this game is not a turn based JRPG like Persona 5. This is more akin to the dynasty warrior games where lots of enemies are on the screen and you do lots of attacks to defeat the enemies. The thing is that this game works in so many systems from Persona 5 that it truly feels like a sequel despite not being the same type of game. Personas level up and learn new moves. There is a bonding system for you and your party that gets worked into a skill tree. It just feels like the creators cared and really tried to work in as much as they could from Persona 5 into this game.\nI personally don't really care for dynasty warrior style games and I still loved playing this and had a great time. I wouldn't pay full price for it unless you like dynasty warriors style games, but if you are a Persona 5 fan and this is on sale then I can highly recommend it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5673bc0997c3558f83f7f68010722c7d", "author": "46245f1b63a155e1b6b691bab58801ba", "date": "2024-01-05", "hours": 76, "content": "you dont have to sleep as much as in persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "352a687bdfba5b9c9bfb9b8cd5d4692d", "author": "41bc95d9dbda5b46adb35800366a2035", "date": "2024-01-05", "hours": 6000, "content": "Persona\u00ae 5 Strikers?\n\nMore like...

In fact if someone told me this started out as a PS Vita game in development and moved on to PS4/PC when that system was ended.  I would have believed them.  The first thing that came to my mind when playing it was KH Dreamdrop on the 3DS with its love of open parkour.  If could forgive them if that was the case but when those games like KH portable titles or Crisis core were made by in house Devs.  Strikers is a Keoi Techmo spin off so if you don't know that means.  Butts and the same tired Dynasty warriors power fantasy game play from 20 years ago.  If you like way to many crap filling your screen and jumping in head first.  You will like this game.  The best parts for me are the Parts from Persona 5 that carry over like the dialogue.  The charm in the characters and new characters are right out of Original game.  It doesn't take long to see though that corners were cut.  Characters are mentioned but don't appear.  The relationship system has been removed.  Royal is treated like it doesn't exist even though it came out a year before this.  Beside the characters, this really isn't a Persona game but takes itself far to seriously to be treated like the spin off Dancing titles.  Oh and this game claims to have anti-aliasing but you could have fooled me.

One of my favorite parts about the narrative is it really does feel like a full road trip/adventure with the gang you got in P5. All too often in JRPGs you get all your party members assembled at the last moments and can feel their chemistry for a only a short few hours. Since this is a continuation of P5 story the whole game has that full team chemistry through it. But still retains the character growth with new characters.\n\nThe only thing that might turn you off of this game is the combat. It seems to be hit or miss for a lot of people. I personally found the combat fun after a few hours, I'm not a huge fan of chaotic beat em up type combat but it still felt well designed and still captures the feel of persona combat.\n\nI'd say this game is worth you're time, just don't try to compare it to base Persona 5 / Royal too much.

After all, I hadn\u2019t played Dynasty Warriors in two decades and had fun with it for a while, and Atlus had a lot of control over the design of Persona 5 Strikers. So, as someone who recently completed Persona 5 Royal and found this game waiting to fill the emptiness of finishing such an outstanding game, I gave it a spin.\n\nThe combat, first, is more intricate than Koei Tecmo\u2019s other musou games. The incorporation of the large roster of personas and their strengths and weaknesses gives it a complexity that the SMT/Persona series is known for. The combat, however, is still Dynasty Warriors to the core, and has the same problem that has plagued it since the beginning: The combat has no sense of impact or energy. You face hordes of enemies that mimic the experience of waving a feather duster at bad actors who were directed to jump back as they see the feather duster waved at them. They fade in, get subjected to a plastic-on-plastic whacking noise, then fade out. They either don\u2019t react at all to being hit or go flying out of range with most of their health remaining.\n\nSecondly, every enemy in the horde will focus fire whichever character you control. This means that when the game gets more difficult, most of your activity will be evading multiple rushes/projectiles while your AI teammates whittle down enemies with minimal use of weakness exploiting mechanics. Combine this with tedious health bars on bosses, and your worst enemy in most encounters will be your own patience. I found myself pounding potions and face-tanking bosses just to get it over with. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if more modern teams like Platinum Games or Team Ninja wouldn\u2019t do a better job translating Persona from turn-based to action combat.\n\nSo, Persona is known for its story! Let\u2019s look at that. It appears as if the developers of P5S were given the impossible task of writing a story that didn\u2019t spoil Persona 5 and consequentially avoids any character development of the original cast. In this respect, it\u2019s as annoying as any fan faction. \u201cHey! Remember how impulsive Ryuji is?! Remember that Morgana hates being a cat and continues to simp for Ann [spoiler]despite learning that he has never been human and is a wizard\u2019s familiar in the form of a cat[/spoiler]?! Remember how Futaba loves to reference video games?!!?!?\u201d That\u2019s right, just lean into one dimension of each character. That\u2019s fan fiction done right! And typical of the most annoying parts of Persona, they often add too much dialogue such as, \u201cAwesome we unlocked this door! Now we can get further in!\u201d Wow, no kidding? Thanks for the commentary, especially when we have twenty lines of dialogue explaining the most obvious puzzles in gaming. A moveable crate to access a high elevation? We\u2019re going to need two cut scenes to explain this never-seen-before game mechanic.\n\nAll respect to Zenkichi, though, he\u2019s well-written, but let\u2019s get into Sophia, the AI, that after leaving the metaverse, gets unrestricted access to the internet. The internet, unrestricted, meaning she can see all the tourism videos, all of Shakespeare, all of Dostoyevsky, every dictionary in every language, then two lines later asks, \u201cWhat does that word mean?\u201d, then proceeds to act like a na\u00efve child through the entire game, trapped in a smartphone connected to the internet, asking to be dipped into the ocean to learn about fish? Why are they falling for this hot garbage? Why are you? Sophia already has access to almost all of the knowledge there is. Atlus, if you wanted her to be a closed-circuit robot, don\u2019t make her an AI. I had to finish the game to see if they redeemed her as a ploy to exploit foolish high schoolers who never wondered for a second why an AI connected to the internet was being asked to be explained and shown things that it could have searched at light speed but left disappointed.\n\nSo, should a Persona 5 fan play it? I don\u2019t know. I personally don't recommend it. The last half felt like a chore. I only finished it so I could see the story to its conclusion because Persona 5 Royal had such a great ending. Persona 5 Strikers did not and is mediocre fan fiction at best.

It goes further beyond what Atlus achieved with Persona 4 Arena and presents a true continuation of the story in both plot and themes. It is a shorter experience compared to P5 but for some it might be a blessing, but even so it\u2019s still worth every second of your time if you really enjoyed P5.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2] \nFirst off, it\u2019s worth noting that this game requires you to have played through either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. All of the main cast are post-character development so don\u2019t expect any of that here. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that all story additions done in P5R are ignored in this game. That\u2019s because this game and Royal were developed at the same time and since this game is a sequel, I guess Atlus didn\u2019t think enough people would have played Royal within the 4 months in between the two releases. The story is a perfect continuation piece, with every boss connecting to a different member of the Phantom Thieves. You get these moments where the game essentially presents the bad endings of the whole cast through these new enemies and it\u2019s outstanding use of themes of the previous game. Where P5/R was about finding yourself and believing in your ideals regardless of what society believes, this game presents the bosses as people who\u2019ve lost themselves in society\u2019s chains. Their ideals and true selves corrupted to desperately fit in with the rest, creating this parallel with the main cast. Unfortunately the game decides to recreate the last section of the original game in its own way and aside from a key plot twist during this section the rest of it falls flat due to giving a much worse version of P5\u2019s final boss. Imagine the game as one 45~ hour long social link, reuniting with friends and seeing them do the stupidest and funniest things ever.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2] \nIt\u2019s a mix of Warriors gameplay with Persona abilities accessible on the fly. This game is probably the best example of Persona as an Action RPG, as it carries over the Persona abilities with nothing cut. You aren\u2019t restricted to four abilities like in other warriors games, you actually have the full arsenal of abilities and you aren\u2019t restricted to a single persona. Persona summoning is brought back with it functioning the exact same way it does in P5, but the amount of person available this game is severely cut and it\u2019s probably for the best because there isn\u2019t much reason to mix and match here. Bosses are subject to the Persona element system and so are you depending on what Persona is equipped but the way it\u2019s transitioned over into this game is perfect. My only gripe is that because it\u2019s a Warriors game there\u2019s no need to ever use the wide range versions of the element attacks because the regular range is already enough and the sacrifice in attack power isn\u2019t worth it. Being a full-fledged sequel it means that traversal hub worlds are also available here and the new locations look really good. The game also makes a deliberate choice to avoid the locations of Persona 3/4, so don\u2019t expect anything from that. \n\nThe point in all of us is that this game is a must play if you loved Persona 5, hell you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice avoiding this experience. Even if you think you don\u2019t like the Warriors gameplay, this is very easily one of the most friendly games in the series as it honestly just feels like Persona as an Action RPG. Who wouldn\u2019t want another adventure with the best friend group you could find in gaming.\n", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "27836ca7c2ed5639a6afaf15590ffeed", "author": "ee91ee83a1b952d0b28395e416cf93b3", "date": "2023-11-18", "hours": 544, "content": "Persona 5 2: \"Not again!?\"", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f1000880e0a65a64bc339f3dbe9acaf0", "author": "3489cd6584ab51048503af8843357691", "date": "2023-11-17", "hours": 236, "content": "Steam Deck support when? :(", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 50, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c1068aa996275ed0b5fedb7c9972008a", "author": "073bf3ed81ab53c8994b34ee597f68ba", "date": "2023-11-17", "hours": 5707, "content": "As someone who's an avid enjoyer of Atlus's Persona franchise, despite this spin-off's combat resembling more of a Dynasty Warriors-esque game versus the traditional mainline turn-based RPG style, everything you'd expect from say the Persona 5 base game (excluding social links) is retained here but just executed in a more action-RPG like fashion.

Persona 3 FES & Portable, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Persona 5 Royal, the dancing games, Persona Q, the list goes on. And while its obvious that the mainline Persona games will always be a lot better than the spin offs, that doesn't mean the spin off titles are bad or not worth playing, unfortunately Persona 5 Strikers just isn't one of those titles.\n\nP5S is a spin off of the vanilla Persona 5 storyline as it came out before Royal did in Japan, so no Kasmui or Maruki talk (or even Akechi for some reason) but what really hurts the story in my opinion is the fact the story just isnt as impactful or even as interesting. It feels like you're watching a really long list of filler in an anime you really like but its a 40 hour game instead of 20 or so episodes. It's like if they made a video game of the Infinite Tsukuyomi for all the Naruto Shippuden fans out there. A lot of the dialogue, villains, and even pacing feels like all that, and while its initially refreshing to see the Phantom Thieves return in their glory, the magic fades a lot faster than expected because of this. A lot of the story often repeats itself by doing the same thing after every dungeon is completed, or it straight up reuses ideas from the original Persona 5 game.  Not to say there isn't any funny and cool scenes to look at here or there, but it just isn't enough to save it, especially compared to Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal.\n\n\nAs for the gameplay, they went for a completely different route by using a dynasty warriors beat em up in hordes apporach while using persona mechanics. You can still collect and fuse Personas, cast spells and status aliments, and even the other PT members are fully playable which all sounds really nice except for the fact that the main gameplay doesnt really work as well as you think it does. The dungeons are LONG with really weird and confusing areas as youre climbing, jumping, and running all over the place just trying to figure out where you need to go while shadows try chasing you down. It's really easy to get lost in naviagation because of the weird layout these dungeons have, There's gonna be a lot of \"Oh we're here now but the path is blocked, we're gonna have to find the key to open this block so we can use it, but first we gotta defeat hordes of shadows or protect Futaba while she's hacking in order to get to the other area that has the key we need and then go all the way BACK to open the spot we found originally.\" That's more or less, exactly what you'll be doing in almost every dungeon, especially the later ones. It gets boring after awhile, combine that with the annoyingly long and hard boss fights and the time it takes for you to get used to the layout of the dungeon of where you need to go, this game will soak up a good chunk of your time the first time around. \n\nThe actual dynasty warriors stuff is actually great since they added the persona spice onto it, and I actually enjoy other dynasty warrior games like Hyrule Warriors and One Piece Pirate Warriors for example, which is why I thought I would like Persona 5 Strikers just as much if not more. But those obstacles really get in the way to the point I was playing just so I can see how it ends and finish the game.\n\nAs much as I tried liking and defending this game, I think this is the first Persona game I ended up not really enjoying.  The original Persona 4 Arena story and Persona 4 Dancing stories were pretty boring too, but at least they absolutely killed it with gameplay. While its unique in P5S, it just doesn't save it from the problems it has.  I'd skip on this title unless you're a Persona enthusiast that wants to see everything in every game. I recommend Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight or the upcoming Persona 5 Tactica instead.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fb345e2007065defa80da0228f622cf9", "author": "5c69f45d597358a89c98b3b36cd7a6e8", "date": "2023-11-13", "hours": 3420, "content": "A fun spin-off, nothing more or less.

It's not bad, but I dont recommend playing it:\n\nThe first three arcs provided nothing new to what was already seen in persona 5 and felt like filler.\nThe pacing is unbalanced in that the story sections pass by really quickly and break one of the biggest rules in storytelling, \"show, dont tell.\" In other words, a lot of information is told instead of being shown. In contrast, dungeon exploration is long and repetitive. That is partially due to the tedious request system that drags out this already long game much more than it should. (i want my 53 hours back)\n(To those that like persona, be warned that this game has very few social interactions and barely builds upon the phantom thieves as characters)\nthe combat is alright i guess\n\nThe dialogue might be the worst part. The game is filled with scenes of characters standing in a circle doing the same three talking animations, discussing matters you should not be expected to care about as half of the plot events have no stakes involved.\nIts not that big of a deal but it really bothered me seeing the characters perform the same two animations in all the discussion scenes.\nThat being said the game does slowly get better after the first few arcs and had its moments where it truly felt like persona.\nand i must say the soundtrack did not disappoint of course\n\n\nIn summary, not worth your time unless you REALLY enjoyed persona 5. Otherwise, you'd have just as much fun or even more watching a playthrough rather than actually playing it.

Personally it was overwhelming at first but by the end it felt natural\n\nThe mediocre:\n\n\u2022Dungeon design was often pretty boring and sometimes confusing, idk could be a me problem\n\n\u2022Merciless mode (which is ng+ exclusive) is actually hard. No really, breaking the game is a prerequisite\n\n\u2022Fusion system is \"simplified\", which actually makes fusing personas you want a lot more complicated\n\n\u2022Random drops from enemies are stingy and make no sense, I've played for 126 hours and still don't have some very basic \"whatever boost\" skill cards. The drop pools are seemingly so large that farming is a fool's errand. On the bright side you shouldn't really need to farm\n\n\u2022No control for AI companions, can't give them even basic commands like \"Stop spamming heals the moment anyone takes a bit of damage we have 6 million healing items in inventory you're gonna run out of SP and become useless\". Also they suck at dodging certain attacks. Additionally, as far as I've seen, they don't use any special attacks or master arts or anything, which is understandable but still pretty lame\n\nThe bad:\n\n\u2022The difficulty suffers from \"Persona Syndrome\", where the beginning of the game is needlessly difficult and then it gets easier as time goes on as you unlock more skills, level up, get more items, etc. This is especially true in this game; at the beginning on Normal difficulty random mini-bosses will shrug off your attacks and one tap you, but by the end of the game you feel practically unstoppable. This makes the early to mid game a massive slog\n\nThe worst:\n\n\u2022The final boss is just boring on Normal, but on Merciless it's absolutely the worst part of the game hands down. Mashing buttons for 30 mins turns you braindead. You also have to beat the fight 3 times to unlock the secret boss as well, which is not fun at all\n\n\u2022The final boss on Merciless, again\n\n\u2022The final boss on Merciless, but now it's \"painful past +\" so it has even more health, hits harder, faster, etc. Essentially translates to \"takes even more time to kill\"", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 21, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e5ddb2c901a054aeb1f7a52a3ff026c8", "author": "55fd64864f18581abcb8aee55bc4a5c4", "date": "2023-09-29", "hours": 1765, "content": "Looking Cool Joker!

It took me a bit to finish despite how short the game is compared to the main game, mainly because of Genshin and Honkai Star Rail lol. \n\nP5S was able to replicate the aesthetic that the main game had which is nice, and of course, the music does not disappoint. Even though it reused multiple songs and had reprises of some of the songs from the original game, the few new songs they do add are bangers.\n\nThis game was both really different yet pretty similar to P5R. When it comes to the hack-and-slash part of the game It's pretty fun, especially for casual players, but in terms of difficulty, the game didn't really pose any challenge, especially in the later half of the game, which caused me to lose interest in the game from time to time. \n\nNow when it comes to the story and character interactions, it's really similar to P5R which was the main reason why I was able to finish it. Of course, in my opinion, the story wasn't as great as P5R, but despite that, it was still able to really immerse me in some parts of the game. I also really loved the introduction of both Sophia and Zenkichi, I love them both as characters and find them very charming characters, It was to the point where some scenes involving them really moved me. Also, another thing I liked about the game is that it gave me closure for P5R, just like the ending of P4G.\n\nWould I recommend this game, yes and no, I chose yes on Steam because I personally like it, but there are many things about the game that I can see people dropping or choosing to not play the game over. Also, I do not think this game should be 60 dollars, especially since P5R is also 60 dollars. The game only takes around 30 to 35 hours to finish, there's not that much replayability, and the combat aspect of the game is mostly different from P5R so setting the game at 60 dollars really makes it hard for other P5 fans to justify a purchase like this. Hell, the only reason I got the game was because it was on discount and I was desperate for a Persona game.\n\nAnyway those were my thoughts on the game, very fun, now time to wait for the release of P3R :)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f40c6b51efec59128b6321011dca8631", "author": "459cff28d4895c378c5917a919b3331f", "date": "2023-09-18", "hours": 1276, "content": "Did you bond with The Phantom Thieves while playing through Persona 5 Royal?

The solution is to go to Windows Task Manager - Details, then right click and set the game's process to full CPU affinity.\n\nI'm putting this here not only to help potential buyers, but also criticize such blatant disregard for PC port. I am prepared for Koei games to have abysmal PC versions but this takes the cake. The game even starts in a window, for fk's sake... The fact that it's so easy to fix means that devs didn't care at all.\n\n[h1]Initial impressions[/h1]\nI expected a musou game with Persona 5 characters, but this game actually plays a lot more like Persona 5 than I anticipated. Walking around town, talking to NPCs, VN-style cutscenes, equipment, even typical dungeon design - it's all here. It's just the combat that's different. From what I can see - you don't get large maps filled with enemies or forts to capture like in most other modern musou games - you explore a palace like in Persona 5 and when you encounter enemies - you fight an enlarged group of them like in a musou title.\n\nCombat itself is what you'd expect out of a game in this genre. Works well, has it's own spin with persona switching, guns, etc. Makes good use of what we've seen in Persona 5 to create a unique musou experience.\n\nStory is also far more involved than I expected. It's not really a sequel, but calling it a spin-off would be an understatement. It takes place after the events of Persona 5 (but without extra events of Royal edition or it's characters). It introduces completely new additions to Phantom Thieves roster as well as new threats with full-blown anime cutscenes, fully-voiced dialogue and everything you could expect out of a sequel to Persona 5. But if we ever get a sequel to Persona 5, I doubt this would be the story they continue, more likely they would continuoe from the events of Royal.\n\nThen again, it would be very unlike ATLUS to create a proper sequel to a Persona game anyway. Point is - don't treat this like a sequel, but also expect a level of storytelling and quality that's higher than a typical musou spin-off like Fire Emblem Warriors.\n\n[h1]Should you buy it?[/h1]\nI think so. Despite me putting this review at 'not recommended', I have high hopes that it's going to be a great Persona musou game, combining both franchises into a surprisingly strong whole.\n\nBut the way PC ports are treated by Koei is not something I will excuse. If not for the fixable stutter I would recommend this easily. However I may change my mind in the future. If the game ends up being incredibly impressive I may put it on a 'recommended' verdict despite the stutter.

Developed by P-Studio and Omega Force, this spin-off game offers an engaging and refreshing take on the Persona formula.One of the strongest aspects of the game is its captivating storyline. Persona 5 Strikers takes place a few months after the events of Persona 5, where the Phantom Thieves reunite for a summer road trip across Japan. The narrative delves into the group's inner struggles and their attempt to solve a mysterious supernatural conspiracy that threatens to distort people's desires. The well-written dialogue, character development, and overarching themes of friendship and justice are reminiscent of the original game, making it a worthwhile continuation for fans.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics in Persona 5 Strikers add a new layer of excitement to the series. Combining hack-and-slash combat with role-playing elements, players can control any member of the Phantom Thieves with their unique skills and personas. The battles are fast-paced and exhilarating, with a wide range of enemies and stunning visual effects. Despite the hack-and-slash nature, strategic elements such as exploiting enemy weaknesses and switching characters on the fly still play a vital role, preserving the strategic depth Persona 5 fans love.\n\n,MY RATINGS: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)\n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 16, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3603f0b620ec5423b1fa75b84c9e355a", "author": "d17f0538d61e5a14a90745ffc2e59b83", "date": "2023-08-26", "hours": 2962, "content": "It's more Persona 5 so if you liked Royal then you'll probably already be playing this anyway.\n\nI like that because the tone of this game's story is less serious than Royal it gives more time to the characters interacting/joking around as a group and there's more social events which I feel was missing a little from PS5R.\n\nOverall the experience is more streamlined with no daily calendar to worry about or social links but is instead all about the dungeons/story. Slightly disappointed some of the social link decisions didn't carry over from PS5R but then Royal didn't reflect completing social links in the main story's dialogue well either.\n\nI liked the new fighting probably more than the turn based stuff in the main game.\n\nThe sidequests are pretty crap and would've liked to see some more social interactions when completing requests for party members instead of just a few lines of dialogue in the menu screen.\n\nDuring dungeons at any checkpoint you can restore the party's HP/SP to full for free by leaving the dungeon and returning to the checkpoint with no expense other than sitting through the loading screens. Time doesn't progress or anything there's literally no reason not to do this so every checkpoint should just be made an auto-heal to full.\n\nThe new characters where good and wasn't too disappointed that characters from Royal where missing.\n\nAlthough the story isn't as good as PS5R I didn't expect it to be and is still interesting enough.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d7bcbad50b9f5dd9ba4b6062b8baa2d7", "author": "0df867727bd356e7b87ae9ef0a84323c", "date": "2023-08-25", "hours": 2520, "content": "A must-buy for anyone who needs more Persona 5.

I went into it expecting a good mindless hack and slash action RPG with a story that will at least be not bad, yet even that was too much to ask. And while I didn\u2019t hate the title and even occasionally enjoyed it, I\u2019m not sure who the audience for this game is supposed to be.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a curious title. It\u2019s far from the first Persona game to be a story continuation of some kind \u2013 Persona Q, Dancing All Night or Arena games are all considered canon. But it is a direct canonical sequel to Persona 5 (and Royal) to the point where it was marketed as P5 2 in some promotional materials. The title was developed by Omega Force, best known for their Dynasty Warriors games (usually called musou games, from the Japanese title for the series), so it\u2019s a hack and slash with elements of an action RPG instead of a turn-based RPG. While I\u2019ve played and enjoyed only a couple of the Dynasty Warriors titles in the past, I do know that usually their titles are about territory control over big maps with lots and lots of enemies on screen. This game doesn\u2019t play like that.\n\nInstead, Persona 5 Strikers tries to employ an approach closer to how P5 worked. You still have a stealth aspect and an ability to hide and ambush shadows. Shadows are still patrolling the levels in very small numbers only to reveal more of themselves once the battle starts and battles still work as a separate game mode, with a clear boarder you can escape from and a post battle results screen. Locations are also still operating on the Persona logic of certain activities available in the real world and combat taking place in another layer of reality, with several such dungeons available across the game. Magic spells, Persona usage, collection and creation is retained, as are minor aspects of the social life.\n\nBut then the rest of the mechanics are swapped for an action game. Fights are hack and slash and you can juggle dozens of shadows in the air at once. You can jump, have air combos and more movement options. Time management aspect is completely gone and time only advances via story, meaning that you can usually enter and exit dungeons at any point with no downsides. A lot of systems are simplified and the only mechanical aspect of social life is represented via a system of permanent upgrades for you and your team. Every character has their own fighting style and strategy\u2026 Although, you will simply mash buttons most of the time as that\u2019s how these games tend to work.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to have a somewhat mindless hack and slash now and then, but Persona 5 Strikers doesn\u2019t feel that good. I like how you can quickly dash across the battle area and perform cool special attacks, but everything about the combat in the game feels sluggish. Like \u2013 there\u2019s a dedicated dodge button, but it works half the time, often with a delay\u2026 until it decides to works perfectly fine. Or how some contextual actions tied to one single button are usually prioritized in a smart way, except when they misfire and instead of an All out attack you\u2019re suddenly riding a skateboard. I didn\u2019t expect Platinum Games combat, of course, but even Tokyo Xanadu eX+ had a better one and that game is far from being fun.\n\nAll of which then ties to just how dated the design of the game feels. Even Persona 3, for how frustrating some of its design decisions were, feels far friendlier than this title. There are so many pointless loading screens for every little thing. Some side quests require you to talk to a person, then need to go back to your car with a loading screen, accept the request, exit the car with a loading screen, go talk to another person in another location with a loading screen, who gives you another request, so you load back into the car to accept the request, to then go into a dungeon with a loading screen, to then start playing the dungeon with a loading screen or a long cutscene, to then do menial tasks for the request\u2026 And if you think just confirming that you\u2019ve completed said requests requires less steps you\u2019re mistaken. It\u2019s stupid how much stuff is inconvenient in ways I\u2019ve not seen since Playstation 2 days.\n\nThen again, even the audio and visual aspects of the game are such a downgrade. Visually the game isn\u2019t bad, but it doesn\u2019t have that same bold striking vision that P5 has. While the music is\u2026 There are a couple of good new tracks, but the rest are either bland or horrible butt rock arrangements of tracks from P5, that sound as if they were composed and performed by a 50 year old rocker dude who thinks he\u2019s very cool.\n\nThe story is pointless, as in most ways it\u2019s a revisit of the exact same main plot idea from P5, but much worse. New characters aren\u2019t particularly interesting, but that\u2019s not the the issue. The sad thing is that the returning cast feels\u2026 How do I even describe it\u2026 You know how in the 80s and 90s there were TV shows based on movies and they would often have the characters from the movie and same premise, but everything was simplified and every episode had to maintain the status quo and there was no overall story progression? Characters feel like that \u2013 like they were simplified down to their most basic aspects. As if they regressed from who they were at the end of P5 (even if you\u2019ve ignored going through their personal stories). Or here\u2019s another status quo \u2013 the protagonist never tells anyone about the Velvet Room, even though everyone personally experienced it, seemingly just because \u201cthat\u2019s how it was in P5 for the most part\u201d. I know it might be weird to get hung up on the story and characters in a musou game, but it\u2019s also a Persona game. You know, a game with a good story, where personal relationships aren\u2019t just important for said story but are also its defining gameplay mechanic?\n\nSo I simply do not see the audience for this game. It\u2019s not a good hack and slash \u2013 it\u2019s decent enough to be sometimes enjoyable, but not fantastic. The story sucks and feels like an average fanfiction about the characters you grew to like, rather than a sequel. It\u2019s not as stylish or cool sounding as main Persona games. It has no substitute for the fun turn-based aspect of the main game, but is also not mindless and silly enough to be entertaining in the way a Dynasty Warrior game can be. I did finish the game and there were moments where I found myself enjoying the silly spectacle on the screen, but I can\u2019t say that it was worth it. Might be for you, if you find any of what I\u2019ve described alluring. And I do hope to see an action oriented spin-off for Persona someday. Just, maybe do it with Nihon Falcom next time, Atlus.

The story isn't exceptionally good or anything, just a fun summer trip with friends but the gameplay is quite solid.\n\n Great soundtrack, didn't understand a world including the english parts. Performance were solid, not a single frame dropped, the UI is a little bit blurry but that's about it. The game isn't hard, enemies are just spongy on higher difficulty unless you can consistently inflict ailments for technical hits, no extra money or exp for playing on higher difficulty. Unless you want to grind, play on normal mode, it's hard to keep the entire team up to your level without grinding much.\n\n The game is surprisingly good for a spin-off especially when the franchise is all about turn-based combat. It's an Action JRPG with Musou combat, not a Musou game with JRPG story elements so don't expect to just spam combos to win like a Musou game. You have to use Persona skills and combos that end with a persona attack to exploit enemy weaknesses to break enemy shields so you can perform an All Out Attack which is your highest single attack damage.\n The time pause when you bring up Persona menu or using gun so use that to reposition yourself during combat because this game is quite a visual clutter, for the first 2 jails I couldn't understand what was happening on the screen. The first 2 Jails gonna be a bit tough because you don't have a lot of SP or recovery items, you can leave jail at any checkpoints to recover HP & SP for free as well as refresh shop's stocks.\n You can play as any characters in the party but everyone only has one persona except for MC, Joker. Different weapons and movesets for everyone, you'll be playing with a party of 5 but one character will always be in your party but unplayable so you'll have Joker and 3 other characters to switch during combat, you can switch party members at any time as long as you're not in combat. Would have been nice if there were custom strategy for AI companions like Tales of Arise.\n You get new persona by either getting a mask drop from killing personas or through fusion, some personas can only be acquired through fusion, when you fuse personas the new persona can inherit up to 5 skills from the parents. You can spend hours trying to figure out how to pass skills that you wanted to your favorite persona, which was quite fun for me or you can just follow a guide.\n New weapons, armors and accessories are locked behind progress, some come from chests or side quests. On certain days during the story you will get new side quests in form of requests, most of them are kill enemies by exploiting their weakness, run to a location without triggering the alarm, collecting junks, refight bosses, fuse a persona to have a specific skill, find an item in jails. Some requests take place in real world, provide interactions between characters and are missable.\n\n Overall the game is solid, I enjoyed it, the first jail is a bit rough but once you get passed it the game become a bit easier, nothing much to complain really except for one achievement that will stop you from 100% the game because it require a stupid amount of grinds for bond experiences, like 15-20 hours just to get the last 30 levels. If you don't care about achievements then the game is one smooth 50-70 hours experience.\n \n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b10ced20647452a493d263a7252a3c22", "author": "247c4fd055bb517cb0031c1dc7a60247", "date": "2023-07-25", "hours": 268, "content": "played this game on switch summer 2021 when it came out did not learn i could switch persona mid battle until the post game. now 2 years later i get to enjoy the game mechanics actually knowing what im doing. atlus never misses with the plot either - plenty of laughs cries and moments that actually make you stop and think about like morals and stuff i guess. anyways yeah get this game sophia is cool shes the best", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ae37bede25955b52a18540e90a9e6040", "author": "c2014c843c9851be8cb8d42c916d4870", "date": "2023-07-25", "hours": 2401, "content": "Persona 5 (Royal Included) sits in my top ten games.

Story's pretty good, not as thematic as P5 but nonetheless an engaging second outing for the Phantom Thieves. combats fun but a bit tedious. dungeons are cool thematically but overlong and devoid of puzzle-solving. figuring out how to trigger elemental attacks without SP is a gamechanger, and im super pleased with the variety each character has in playstyle; Joker is a bit of a Jack of all Trades, just as he should be, Ryuji and Haru are heavies (both have different combos), Yusuke and newcomer Zenkichi are basically DPS, and Morgana and Makoto are basically healers/buffs. Each character has their own combos inspired by their elements and weapons of choice (Ann imbues her whip with fire, Haru does a spin attack with her axe, etc) and each with also expand by using them--as each character gets used in combat, they unlock more powerful combos. Follow-Ups from P5 return in slightly a different way: when an enemy is staggered, you can switch to the prompted character to trigger a powerful follow-up attack. The baton pass mechanic has also been reworked into an instant switch to active character, so at anytime, you can switch to a character that may better suit the circumstances. A \"Showtime\" attack can be activated once a meter has been filled to either deal heavy damage or clear a room. Each character has their own unique animation for these. Bosses are proper hard, necessitating teamwork and frequent switching, clever use of Showtime, as well as engagement with the dodging and weakness mechanics--this is a very different game from the Persona series' usual turn based MO.\n\nThe story starts really strong and kinda peters out. At first, you may be given the impression that its retreading the personal themes of each thief to further flesh out their character (the first villain relates to Ann, second Yusuke, third Haru) but it drops this seemingly to get on with the actual plot of whose behind it all. Newcomer Sofie/Sofia is charming and helpful as an AI character (which also allows Futaba to shine a little) and is a decently worthy addition to the crew. some noteworthy early absences feel baffling (why are both Iwai AND Takemi not in their usual spots? Not to mention Sumire, but tbf this is a sequel to P5, not P5R) as well as a few missed opportunities to have fun cameos from others admittedly kinda drag it down.\n\nMy one major complaint comes down to the Covid pandemic; this game's voice acting was recorded remotely. While each actor is better and more comfortable as their characters and the acting is generally great, the mixing is not. even after fiddling with the audio, i haven't found a set of options that makes the music and dialogue feel like they have the right volumes. other than that, its a bit tedious, but if you like the characters, its basically a no brainer.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "770d5a16b37150be92653f36264cd29d", "author": "cdbdf2f4d0d9550182d1610f58b6faef", "date": "2023-07-15", "hours": 5463, "content": "man this game is grindy as fuck", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5b24712ba8c853188a2264dce9bde8ef", "author": "b705d92003585f4ca87b9023c70ceddb", "date": "2023-07-15", "hours": 1787, "content": "Gameplay is meh\nstory is resident sleeper\n\nOverrated", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b3d8624023e25e5899f31e9bdd5a7c61", "author": "31d164d4d2d259abaa288785d1830d49", "date": "2023-07-14", "hours": 1070, "content": "Really love this game, sequel after Persona 5 royal that deliver us new stories with the new dungeons & also a lot of new explore cities", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4531779e846a5b61ac067c5cc9acb0a4", "author": "4a680ddca9ee554f8861701091e1fd0d", "date": "2023-07-14", "hours": 1604, "content": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

TLDR? Good Luck.\nMy interest in the game itself? Pretty okay mostly because I love Persona 5 on its own. (including royal because more story stuff.) Im very interested in the combat on its own, especially since you can use abilities without well. Spending resources if you use your combos right. It can get wild. The art style and the looks like usual are just great. Still some things stick out that arent as unique when compared to Persona 5 but still good. \n\nMy problems with the game right now? It is INCREDIBLY difficult to actually PLAY the game. At least for me, im seeing this same problem with other people on higher end rigs. Mines not really high end at all. However I was able to run Persona 5 Royal on max, never had a single frame drop to my memory. \nYou are ABLE to run the game max setting without issues absolutely. The problem, is the game is Horribly optimized. The control scheme is written by monkeys on typewriters mans. (I genuinely rebinded all I could to play like dark souls and it was working better than the default.) \nMore on the optimization issues. Running the game in Windowed, Borderless, or Fullscreen Ive continuously ran into the same problems. (Even with running Process Lasso in the background as suggested online.) The game will drastically drop all the way down to running at 5-10 frames. With Process Lasso running the frame rate doesnt really drop often? But the game Slows Down as if it WERE running at that framerate mentioned above. \nThis can happen with any scene transitions, cutscenes, Pre-Rendered cutscenes, and practically anything you can do in the game. Including Showtimes! in combat. \nIve only put 3.5 hours as of this review and have barely made any progress. Its a serious struggle to enjoy it in this state. Please fix this port. \nIll be leaving it as a No until either I can find an option to fix these issues, or the game gets fixed by any amount. \nOh yeah, the camera is also terrible.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "074f24c3465f50b989c91ea3e0c2dd1f", "author": "6a32bfa332c55f3b8598a02a2a35b7b8", "date": "2023-07-03", "hours": 49, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a good game. \n\nIt also runs on Steam Deck/Linux now with minimal effort, using Proton GE 8.3 and the Launch command \"GST_PLUGIN_FEATURE_RANK=protonaudioconverterbin:NONE %command%\" (without the \"\" of course)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 42, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6c445c04db3e54edbd5b4487e66ea53f", "author": "d3a3ddf887f45b26b8b5d5ccfc47a78a", "date": "2023-07-02", "hours": 2028, "content": "If you loved Persona 5, you will enjoy playing this game because it allows you to know more about the Phantom Thieves, have some fun and heartwarming moments with them, and even explore in more detail the philosophical and ethical questions that the previous game discussed. \nBuy if you are a P5 fan ^_^", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dd8469d552a3516b9985eb1102bc0e02", "author": "0e13196f167b56e0a378844ce2f9eee3", "date": "2023-07-01", "hours": 419, "content": "This game is fucking trash.

Some may say it's basically another musou game, but I disagree strongly. There is so much respect to the Persona series gameplay that it essentially feels like the devs just took that and added a musou twist, rather than a musou game with Persona sprinkled in. \nTo really succeed, you need to have strong personas and can't simply treat it as a beat-em-up. You have elemental weaknesses/strengths, almighty damage, critical stun states for stronger enemies, and basically everything in mainline Persona games including persona fusion/execution to make your personas stronger. \nThe usage of personas is extremely fluid, allowing the player to choose a persona using a semi-paused popup menu and executing attacks based on what combo you use. Overall, great gameplay and feels like the expected quality of a mainline game.\n\n[b]Achievements[/b]\nThere's nothing particularly noteworthy of the achievements, and if there were any that were painful, I don't really remember them, indicating that even difficult/tedious ones weren't that bad.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story is somewhat lacking but still holds water. It feels like they took a sequel plot to Persona 5 and watered it down. However, the new character is absolutely charming and adds so much to the story by virtue of being such a great character, but I wish the game could've had a story as deep as the mainline game. What it does instead is take a very light approach, which is acceptable considering it's enough to keep your attention, putting the gameplay first and foremost.\n\n[b]Hate[/b]\nThere's not much to actually hate about this game, and I really implore anyone to buy it even if it's not on sale. I wish there was more story, more to be explored, and just more overall, but the experience was absolutely worth every penny.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "22f5b54d3f54523b9a9d45286d82f920", "author": "7bd5617b70035198be929d5ab31481fc", "date": "2023-05-29", "hours": 5137, "content": "i really like zenkichi way more than akechi", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c2ea7c2eb7ca50b385767a23c47a70ff", "author": "f3928588a99e53778275893725541d11", "date": "2023-05-28", "hours": 2299, "content": "Playing Persona 5 first is a must to enjoy the story.

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 7, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a93fa47ca7335c07b69cf8191db142ec", "author": "26e5425c017d5a179e2387b33505357b", "date": "2023-05-14", "hours": 561, "content": "Buy P5R instead.

In fact, I played this on Easy difficulty to reduce the grind.\nBut, it was absolutely worth it. The story is a direct continuation from Persona 5, and it brings all the style and themes from the orginal, including the grandiose Palaces (called \"Jails\" here), a fantastic soundtrack of both remixes and new songs, and all the crew from the original game. Some new characters are also introduced and they mesh very well with the old cast, which have grown so comfortable with their company to the point where lots of hilarious shenanigans take place on a regular basis.

As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume.

But if you also don't like Warriors games, reconsider carefully.\n\nAlso, the fact that there is no punishment to just leave mementos to get a full heal is a big issue. It should just heal you by interracting with the checkpoint/teleporter. At this stage, you spend several minutes every time you reach a checkpoint just to teleport out and back in. With several unskippable transitions and loading screens. It's a pain.\n\nIt's also a pain to run, but you'll find a fix for that down below.\n\n\n\n!FIX TO PLAY THIS GAME ON MODERN HARDWARE!\n\n\nBig ups to NoobMasterB in the comments here. The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAll of this shouldn't be neccessary, but it is.

People might miss them completely)\n\n4.5/10 game review, done about 1/4-1/2 the way through the game\n\nGame Play: 3 (controls messy out of the box, camera can be janky), game balance is whacked\nGame Mechanics: 4 ( a good nod to the original but it clashes with the main theme of the combat and it lacks 'soul')\nGraphics: 7 (good, true to original)\nSound/Dub: 7 (good, true to original)\nPlot: 5 (neither good nor bad, little reference to original but doesn't mess with it either)\n\nFor some reason, some of the cut scenes lag. I suspect a porting problem.\n\nCombat is odd. Do you like kicking puppies? Be prepared to kick puppies dozens at a time, because that's the feeling I get taking on a million trash mobs that are no threat with so much happening on the screen that hardly matters, so my brain shuts down and I don't much care. I get this is a type a brand of game on it's own, but it doesn't seem interesting or well done.\n\nThe story does make references back to P5 in a fashion. Slight ones. After all, we know the police aren't fond of joker because of the whole \"No we are the Power and you will BOW to our Awe-Thor-itay because if you don't Society will CRUMBLE\" mindset the japanese have as an excuse for their brand of fascist government and law enforcement (99% conviction rates in court, that's some bull). Heaven forbid there be a hero anyone else look up to that's not them, or anyone else with any real power.\n\nThey added the cute little ballerina, a twisted character I didn't approve of but came to enjoy in PS5R. Then replaced her with an AI in this game. Disappointed.\n\nIt has been done in a way that doesn't mess with the original, lets you go back and enjoy some nostalgia and a different type of game play. I still greatly prefer the original. Dubbing/voices, and artwork are a great match for the original at least, and characters so far have been true to the source material.\n\nI like being able to main as the other character in game play, but game play differs so much from the original and there's so much 'emptiness' to things like not being able to 'live' in the game and develop relationships naturally like in the other game. Also they did just write some other support characters out, and I miss having them around.\n\nI'd almost have rather had an add on for PS5R, that expanded the phantom theives little den to include interactions and little slice of life stories so that it was like adding one of those story book games or \"choose your own adventure' type books. The 'gameplay' is just janky and I havent figured out how to re key the controls into something sane that doesnt annoy me yet. TBH this is a game for either die hard fans or people clueless about PS5 that just like mind numbing mass slasher games.

This is basically Persona 5 Part 2.

It takes a little getting use to, especially if you just played Persona 5, but I think it works well overall.\n\nThe cast and characters are like your old buddies you got to know in the previous game and still has that certain charm about it.\n\nIt's much shorter than Persona 5 at roughly half the play time, but I do feel that they cut out a lot of the useless time wasting stuff from Persona 5 and really streamlined the game. So overall I think this is fine.\n\nIt's not too difficult on normal difficulty and I think most players should easily be able to beat the game on that setting.\n\nOnly real complaint is on a 12 Gen Intel chip the game does not run correctly. I needed to change the game to run as high priority on my processor in order to stop the game from stuttering like crazy. Some people might run into this issue, in this case I recommend using a program like Process Lasso to set the game to always run with high priority.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f50c533c84895b4a9c1433b85ecd898f", "author": "bc5b166c60395a869795ac42fa84d94e", "date": "2023-04-06", "hours": 5490, "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "48eeaef7df68505f90ca1ef74098e8ad", "author": "80b69f5e621457dcba36bf4f3086515e", "date": "2023-04-06", "hours": 2288, "content": "\u201cStrikers\u201d has the \u201cPersona 5\u201d (P5) DNA all over it.

The \u201cmusou\u201d action genre works great too, implementing Persona-like elements for even better. Nonetheless, it can get repetitive, so I\u2019d advise playing in short sessions.

Also, a crash that costed me hours of progress (no auto-save! Which doesn\u2019t make sense, as the game doesn\u2019t have branching paths or anything alike). That said, I would sincerely recommend \u201cStrikers\u201d to any P5 fan.

The movement and combat itself feels very clunky. Mid-PS2 era clunky, those years where devs were still grappling with having a lot more freedom of movement in 3d space and better tech to support it. They also didnt blend mechanics or gameplay styles, theyve simply jammed them into the same area. Imagine a Dynasty Warriors game, but now  take every single mechanic from P5 and layer it on top. It's too much to handle and it doesnt feel good.\n\nThe smaller mob encounters are also over way too fast for you to get comfortable with the combat, which means by the time you get to a boss you have no idea what youre doing.

It can be a little brain dead at points, but the combats pretty fun (for the most part). Every character (except Morgana) has a fun, if just a little too similar move-set I enjoyed playing and learning. I think Makoto, Haru, and Ryuji were my favourites. The road-trip story is solid, and has some great character moments for all of the phantom thieves, except like Morgana or Futaba (rip) from what I remember (Finally, justice for Haru). Most of the new characters are also great. I love Zenkichi SO MUCH. Even outside of all that, Ryuji gets to say fuck, so the game is automatically a 10/10.\n\nHOWEVER\nThe game has some MASSIVE problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, the PC port is absolutely TERRIBLE. The game constantly stutters to the point of being unplayable. Seriously, I couldn't even get past the first goddamn cutscene when I first tried to play. I had to download an external program called process lasso to get the game to even work properly. The game is also capped at 60 FPS, which isn't the biggest deal, but I found it can quite easily drop below that when things get hectic. Even on hardware which far exceeds the recommended specs. While I'm sure it was a pain the the ass recreating Persona 5's trademark look on a completely different engine, the anti-aliasing makes the game look pretty terrible. But luckily, this can be pretty easily fixed with the few settings tweeks. I also got caught in an infinite loading screen at one point, which was is always my FAVOURITE feature in any game.\n\nUnfortunately the problems don't stop with just the poor porting job. While I liked a good amount of the story bosses (final boss excluded), a good amount of them have WAY too much health. I played on hard so I'm not sure how it is on lower difficulties, but I feel like most bosses ended up outstaying their welcome. I remember one of the optional bosses took me about 20 minutes straight to beat, all while having no extra challenge outside of the time commitment. Also, once I figured out spamming the square + square + triangle combo was BY FAR the most efficient way of playing the game, the combat became far less fun for me. Those are my main issues, but there's a few other issues I have with the combat, like all out attacks feel incredibly under powered, and the camera being pretty janky. The side quest also kinda suck, which is pretty disappointing for a franchise like Persona, where the side content has been one of it's major draws since Persona 3.\n\nThe persona fusion system in this game is also a hot pile of ASS. For some god forsaken reason you need to have high level early game persona for some of the later fusion. This would either take millions of yen of buying and deleting high level personas over and over again, or literal HOURS of grinding. I have no clue who approved this change, but they should be very careful on August 17th 2038 at 7:43 AM.\n\nOverall, I still think strikers is a worthwhile sequel to Persona 5, and I would still recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the original.

Yes, it is super barebones in comparison but it's actually a good way to get used to the system without getting overwhelmed. Before I played this I had watched playthroughs of Persona 3, Persona 5, and either Persona 4 Golden or Persona 4, so I was used to the mechanics. This was a great intro to the system for me before I got Persona 4 Golden, though to be fair I think Persona 4 Golden is simplier than Persona 5 Royal which overwhelmed me a little my first playthrough. There is one main issue with the steam version I have noticed. It buffers a lot. I'll be playing and my screen freezes or is delayed a ton. Sometimes it works out after I mess with setting, but other times not which is why I haven't put more time into this version when my Switch copy has like thirty or so hours of gameplay.

If I didn't know otherwise, I would have assumed it was the original team behind this spin-off. [b]Every step of the way I could feel the love put into this game.[/b] Starting from the story to gameplay and the new music tracks which will enter my playlists!\n\n[b]The story[/b] of Strikers is a lot simpler, while captivating. Whereas in the original you obtain new companions and help them through their hardships, this is a bit less connected to the cast of the game. Compared to the original very black-and-white story with clear villains and heroes, Strikers is a morally greyer story with a unique outlook on its villains. \nIt's worth noting that although Strikers is technically a sequel to Persona 5, [b]the events of Royal are never mentioned[/b], but they are not incompatible on a story level.\nAlthough justified, sadly the player doesn't get to keep the powers from the original title.\n\n[b]Gone is the turn-based combat, replaced with a new action-based combat system[/b], and, while it's wildly different genres, the combat feels very familiar.\n[b]The game is a musou[/b], which literally translates to \"unmatched\" and the main focus of this genre is cutting through hundreds of enemies that are nowhere near your level.  Because of my interest in the characters I went into it knowing it was not necessarily my cup of tea. Regardless, I can see it's one of the best musous out there, with all the faults that might come with the genre.\n[b]This makes fighting fun, but repetitive[/b], especially with the smaller enemies. Because this game is still a Persona, [b]in-between fights there's a lot of story dialogue demanding your attention after waves and waves of enemies that don't[/b]. This is followed by the very peculiar choice of having the first 3 dungeons of the game be almost copy-pasted, only to add all the variety towards the end of the game. \n\nWhen it comes to [b]exploration[/b], compared to the other Personas, [b]this is an extremely linear title [/b]that leaves little to no freedom to the player. The gameplay loop consists of going through cutscenes or brain-dead-ly cutting through waves of enemies when exploring a dungeon that often follows a very specific progression pattern. Rarely it's possible to explore the city and move freely, which would really be just a jog around stores to see if something interesting is for sale. \nWhile the game is more linear, one very positive note compared to the original is that [b]almost all dialogues are dubbed[/b]. Because there were physically fewer dialogues, more could be voice-acted.\n\nThe title suffers a bit from all this repetition in my opinion, but it definitely ramped up in the second half keeping me hooked!\n\nJust like in the original, [b]Requests are back, but[/b] because of the absence of Mementos, [b]it's only fetch quests that instead of adding to the experience, gatekeep abilities and whatnot behind their completion.[/b]\n\n[b]The difficulty[/b] was also a weak point for me, because as it often happens in these titles, [b]it's just numbers, making the fights longer instead of more challenging.[/b]\n\nTo me, [b]Strikers was like when your favorite anime releases a filler movie that doesn't really add anything, but it's still more of the thing you like.[/b] It's a delightful, post-main story of the original, adventure with all the characters I grew to love.  \nAfter reading all this, if you're still convinced to get it, go ahead.

And the performance is pretty inconsistent as well, despite the game being locked to 60fps unlike P5R running flawlessly at 120fps. There are occasional frame drops and stutters, which I don't think should be happening with an i7-12700K and a 3080. And the camera feels weird to control with a mouse (but it's fine with a controller), where it was perfect on P5R with both mouse and a controller, which makes me think they just upscaled the Switch version of the game, leading to unoptimized camera and blurry UI elements. The game is still extremely fun nonetheless, it feels like a lot of care has gone into the music and overall gameplay (along with other things I praised), which is ultimately more important than minor optimization issues, but I'd like the issues to be fixed at the same time, so I can truly feel happy and satisfied playing this game :D", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "810469badfd45137983490d6dc4592aa", "author": "e6e1ce4a6cdd5ecfb790ab535c05ef05", "date": "2023-03-14", "hours": 518, "content": "this is just like among us", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a062048bc40c5be498ae95e262fc793c", "author": "9f69de0599c953cd9c12cd52faf055d2", "date": "2023-03-13", "hours": 4562, "content": "Good Spin off\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "97f11c152be75bbeae250157262f3072", "author": "1c34d3fb13845d11bf84077224517ea3", "date": "2023-03-13", "hours": 1828, "content": "Very nice game.

But I never felt like it was lacking, going through just the story of it. In fact, I appreciated it, because it severely reduced the feeling of *bloat* that was so evident in P5. The pacing is better. But the game is still very dialogue heavy, with some serious moments, emotional moments, and laid back moments, with the crew just hanging out. It was great.\n\nIn other Persona games, I've never really had the urge to go in for a New Game Plus, or post game content, but here - I still have the drive to play, after finishing the story.

There are some scenes I would do without in it, though.

All of that stuff worked in P5 because it was a turn based game. But here, you're fumbling with the controls to desperately do the thing you need to do before you get killed. This process isn't helped by how awkward the control layout is, which to be fair, isn't a design issue, its a result of having so many more key assignments than you'd normally have in an ARPG. Sure, you can reassign them, but that doesn't help with there being way too many RPG-like mechanics in the first place. I suspect no layout could possibly make this mess feel intuitive. \n\nAt the same, the game seems to be critically lacking basic features common to ARPGs: blocking, for instance. I also found out only after dying over and over again that while there is a dodge button, it is too awkward to use reliably (its H, try pressing that repeatedly while keeping your fingers on the standard WASD!) It also doesn't seem to stop the enemies from hitting you with skills, the only way to interrupt them being to down them with their weakness. \n\nWhich isn't a reliable strategy because...you only get enough SP to use skills a few times during each infiltration. Since the red powerful shadow mechanic returns, this basically means you have to avoid those guys entirely. They're minibosses with massive HP sponges that take forever to kill if you can't beat their weakness. And even if you can, it drains all your SP. But don't try saving your SP either, because just sitting there mashing attack will get you killed by their repeated bombardment of undogeable skills before you have a chance to even dent their HP pool. Using non-weakness breaking skills also doesn't help, since they barely do enough damage to dent their HP pool either. \n\nSo what you get at the end of all of this is a system that combines the worst of both worlds. You have the really shallow elemental weakness system that makes fights a cakewalk if you have the right skill, and impossible if you don't. You have to manage it at high speed while fighting in real time, but no simplified moveset that compliments this speed. \n\nYou could try to coast by using the gun and basic attack, but those are really the only ARPG elements and they aren't very effective or deep because the bulk of the game is balanced around the RPG stuff carried over from P5. For instance, all you're really doing if you're not using skills is literally just mashing left mouse button over and over again. There is no timing mechanic, or having to vary your attacks, parry, etc...in other words, the basic fundamentals of an ARPG. Its all automated. \n\nAlso, the screen is way too visually cluttered to even see what is going on or react to enemies properly. It made me really annoyed with the anime art style because sometimes I couldn't even see when an enemy is \"down\" and open for an all out attack because there were too many ridiculously flashy effects happening on the screen at once.\n\nThe story seems like it could be decent, but without breaking it into segments where you can control what you do each day, the game feels very streamlined and gives the player even less agency. The time management is the main thing that makes Persona games feel sorta like real RPGs in the first place, so without that, I just found myself lacking any kind of investment in the story. \n\nSkip this one. Its a JRPG half-assed into a clunky ARPG that doesn't get the high points of either genre correct, and simply re-hashes the main themes and characters of a much longer game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "55f49ccbea595c14a6bb63398971dcf9", "author": "b8e70a9dc77f5138a1ef3ebca53405ce", "date": "2023-03-02", "hours": 6395, "content": "A great sequel to an already amazing game.

It revolves around the Phantom Thieves, with it taking place nearly a year after the events of P5/P5R, with Joker returning to the town once more to meet up with his friends, and with Morgana in tow. However, they then stumbled across another alternate verse in a highly popular new app that had been making it's rounds, with certain individuals making use of this alternate verse.\n\nUnlike P5R however, the 'villains' in this sequel aren't outright 'evil people'. They are still misguided individuals, and need a good dose of reality. But honestly, I prefer them a lot more than the villains in P5R. This game is also a very 'coming-of-age game'. If the prequel focuses only on one town and one area, this game actually has the group travelling across Japan.\n\nEssentially a hack and slash game instead of the turn based combat in the previous game, the game still kept the basics of sneaking around and ambushing enemies.

The writing could actually work if it the characters weren't already established. \n\nMostly recommend the game for it's combat/systems and end of story moments \n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3358424daa8f555fbb90f8e190cb5faa", "author": "bf90c52d2034547bbd90eb26ce41d9c3", "date": "2023-02-18", "hours": 979, "content": "too hard to focus when you're playing as the cat", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3a1ca373d9e65db1928fade071845524", "author": "012fc9c02fd054fab3ea7229f7c02035", "date": "2023-02-17", "hours": 7778, "content": "Its a Persona game.

(1st playthrough)\n\n1. Gameplay\nA wonderful spin-off from the persona series set in the world of persona 5 with a unique twist on the dynasty warriors style. Hack n slash style of gameplay combined with mid fight persona switches and party member tagging. There are also interactable overworld objects that provide cover or grant their own attack options, allowing for different gameplay styles. In addition to persona abilities, all out attack returns and the mechanic of showtime changes up attack combinations and makes for a satisfying playthrough. \n\n2. Story\nEven coming out of Persona 5 Royal with high expectations, Persona 5 Strikers has managed to prove itself to be a worthy sequel in its own right. The journey around Japan on a roadtrip feel so nostalgic and heartwarming. The plot is also a fair continuation to the original Persona 5 with its own twists in its story. As a game focused on battle gameplay and less on story, it manages to do its job well. \n\n3. Characters\nThe return of the Phantom Thieves starts off back at LeBlanc, a heartwarming reunion which brings back memories. The new Phantom Thieves also integrate themselves well into the team, enhancing the story further. The character development arcs of the new characters are great and being able to control each Phantom Thief individually plays perfectly into the immersion. \n\n4. Graphics\nThe overworld is amazing, using the same style as Persona 5 Royal. Each city is different from the next and really takes you on a tour around Japan. The new dungeons are fabulous, each having their own distinct features from those that mimic the real world to fantasy worlds. Attack and movement animations are fluid too. Persona 5 Strikers is without a doubt, visually stunning.\n\n5. Audio\nThe OST in this game is once again, truly phenomenal, I had my doubts that it would come close to Persona 5 Royal, but considering how high the bar is, Strikers has done it. The electric remixes of returning Persona 5 OSTs are fantastic, fitting for the faster game pace of Strikers. Not forgetting the new tracks too, the first Jail's soundtrack was such a hook and made way for all the bangers in the OST, down to the final boss fight. \n\n6. Technical\nGame is bug free and is buttery smooth, not a single crash throughout my playthrough. Load times are short as well.\n\n7. Value\n100% buy, bang for every buck, DLCs included! Even though this style of game isnt my preferred and it took a while to get used to, I loved every bit of it and have 0 regrets. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers offers more replayability compared to Persona 5 Royal and I can't wait to get back in to NG+ after clearing the post game. Fingers crossed that more Phantom Thieves content is on the horizon, as I have come to love the series so much, cmon Atlus make the dream come true.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "86acb6ac91335fdbae48b6e3a49e0d0b", "author": "8052bfe2d7ea5c24a69e0a6d41a2b84b", "date": "2023-02-05", "hours": 2667, "content": "Cool spin-off for Persona 5.

If anything it comes off more as an expansion pack of old. In other words,it picks off right where P5 left off whilst dealing with similar paranormal,psychological,and societal issues.\n\nAs a musou fan I love the action based combat but in trying to adopt mechanics from P5's systems it excels in certain areas and falters in others. This time you have to be much more aware of enemy weaknesses with certain more formidable foes requiring you break their defenses before you can prod at their soft tender underbellies with your attacks.\n\n Additionally there's a clumsy attempt at \"stealth\" and \"surprise ambushing\" that frankly does not carry over well for this kind of genre. Imagine Devil Mat Cry 5 having aspects of Metal-Gear randomly thrown in just for the heck of it. It would make for a rather disjointed stop and go affair wouldn't it? The same applies with Persona Strikers. \"Fortunately\" future unlockable abilities begin to circumvent this problem and everything else from the exploration to the boss-fights is still platinum mint!\n\nThe story-telling,character interactions,and sound-track also deserve praise with even the new characters fitting in as opposed to sticking out like sore thumbs.\n\nWell,\"mostly\". We finally get an adult persona user thrown into the mix but because he's a cop and initially has ulterior motives the main characters constantly dog on him by calling him gramps. Instead of handling the roasting stoically with a wry smile he whines about it incessantly. You know that meme \"How do you do,fellow kids?\". That's  Zenkichi in a nut-shell! Fortunately he eventually moves beyond this annoying first impression by revealing himself to be a more likable person later on. (Thank goodness)\n\nAs for Sophia? I have no problems with her what so ever. Persona 3 already presented the idea of having artificially intelligent robot companions with Aigis so Sophia being an \"ap\" that can manifest a more physical form in the meta-verse makes perfect sense within this continuity. She manages to be innocent and curious yet learns quickly whilst always being helpful.\n \nI also appreciate how Strikers seems more about helping flawed people towards their personal redemption arcs and forgiving them as opposed to simply pursuing them as the bad guys then destroying their livelihoods. Don't misunderstand me,the antagonists in Strikers are still formidable adversaries. It's just this time we get to see the more positive application of \"stealing hearts\" expanded upon similar to how it was used to save Futaba and Sae Niijima.\n\nYet there is an underlying problem with \"Modern Persona\" that permeates Strikers as well. That being that the mundane socializing aspect which is wonderful for character building also undermines the high stakes of the over all meta-plot.\n\nTo me Persona is still apart of the Mega-Ten/Shin-Megami-Tensei brand. That means gods,goddesses,and other mythological beings are \"real\". There are dark uncaring cosmic forces from neighboring dimensions that creep their tendrils into our world to usher forth Armageddon. The only reason we are still here is because the heroes and heroines in these ongoing titles reset reality every so often to ensure humanity as a whole will continue to survive.\n\nBut hey,gotta go to the bad-bad bathhouse with the boys,amirite? Gotta throw some darts,exchange \"gamur speak\" with Futaba, or sing some karaoke to ensure the fans can  immerse themselves in the \"totes believable\" post-modern-pop-culture setting!  Again,I don't want to come off as a grouch. When I first played through Persona 3 and Persona 4 I really did appreciate the social-bonding system as I grew to truly care about even a few of the more insignificant side-npcs. \"But\" when you go about mundane routines within an environment that is not remotely surreal or remotely frightening the whole \"We're under-dogs fighting scary apocalyptic deities in a cosmic horror setting\" part of the SMT formula is watered down significantly.\n     \nStrikers does not have as much of this normie-simulation-filler as its' predecessor \"but\" there is still a lot of dialogue and down time compared to the typical musou outing. No doubt certain people will appreciate this but others will forget they are fighting with dark-forces from beyond the pale as the road-trip-monotony sets in. Strikers would have benefited from a greater sense of urgency. (Same with P5 as well.)  \n\nNow back to the good news! Persona fusions,leveling up,unlockable bond bonuses,and acquiring increasingly better equipment sets are still present. Better yet,you can take control of EVERY Phantom Thief directly. (Save for Futaba and that's a pity. Oh well. She served as the oracle in P5 so it makes sense she's relegated to the roles of hacking and support! I still see it as a missed opportunity though.)\n\nOf all the spin off Persona games I rate \"Strikers\" as the best one thus far even if the transition from turn-based rpg to action combat did not go off entirely smoothly without a hitch. \n\nPros\n\n+The combat,press-turn-system,fusions,and Persona spell-casting carried over surprsingly well into the hack n slash/beat em up format!\n\n+A decent continuation that expands upon the concepts presented in its' predecessor.\n\n+ New characters fit in with the rest of the cast.\n\n+Good soundtrack coupled with the VAs doing a servicible job in their respective roles.\n\n+The exploration and platforming break up the monotony of the battles.\n\n+Objects in the environment can be exploited to give you a more direct advantage during fights.\n\n+Good message about forgiveness and having empathy for others.\n\nCons\n\n-Cannot decide if it is a lighthearted road-trip OVA or a tense paranormal/supernatural/mystery thriller.\n\n-Dialogue and down-time between missions can be very dense,especially if you compare Strikers to other musou games. \n\n- The stealth and \"surprise attack \" mechanics that complimented the dungeon/palace infiltration in Persona 5 come off as a hindrance in Strikers. \n\n-RPG inspired roots ensure there is an intense level of grinding. No,it's not as bad as a gacha game but be ready to commit regardless!\n\n-Where's Katsumi?\n\n-Would have been rad if Goro Akechi made a guest appearance.

P5S is basically just a story expansion pack in terms of its narrative, and retreading old ground is the name of the game. To the point where [spoiler] All the antagonists are just copies of the palace rulers with very slight tweaks, and the main antagonist is literally a somehow worse version of Yaldabaoth, right down to her design. The entire endgame is nearly identical to vanilla p5's: Go through not-mementos to kill not-holy grail to stop a false god devoid of humanity who is attempting to mind control all of mankind because they don't want free will anymore. It's such a step down from Maruki in every way that it enters freefall. [/spoiler]\n\nThe music is still mostly bangers and remixes of bangers, but the normal battle themes, while far from bad, do not even come close to 'take over' or 'last surprise'.\n\nThe gameplay is button mashy, but that's to be expected of a warriors style game. When the combat is fun, it's quite satisfying to pull some crazy move and kill 50 enemies at once. But when it's not fun, you'll be mindlessly hacking at the shins of a massive damage sponge while it one-shots you with every attack.\n\nBut the gameplay isn't what you come to this game for, you come to P5S to spend more time with the characters you love, and the game does a serviceable job giving the phantom thieves plenty more funny and heartfelt moments with each other. Unfortunately though, the game doesn't include any confidants other than the main group, and assumes that you spent valentine's day with Ryuji, meaning that there is very little actual continuation from the original game. Not only that, Yoshizawa doesn't even exist in this game's timeline, as for some baffling reason it was made as a sequel to vanilla P5 and lacks all of the story beats and characters introduced in Royal. The story barely even mentions the events of the original game, and when it does they're often throwaway bits of banter or a single dialogue option that elicits the same response as the other choices.\n\nThe side content SUCKS. Every single request you can get is either a mindless fetch quest in the overworld (without the ability to sprint) or agonisingly boring backtracking to levels you've already cleared. Go to this level and kill this specific enemy that only appears in this one location that's annoying to get to, then kill this specific enemy BUT with a specific character, AND THEN [spoiler] go back and kill the boss of a previous level again with no changes whatsoever. [/spoiler] It's padding at its most egregious, and it straight up locks gameplay perks behind it, making some of them pretty much mandatory.\n\nThe voice acting is way lower quality than in P5 or Royal, which is bizarre since the Va's sound identical to their 2016 selves in the latter. They either were given bad direction or the dev team went with bad takes, and it can be a bit distracting coming fresh off Royal. (Seriously Futaba sounds like she's drunk half the time and Ryuji's voice cracks every other word.)\n\nMassive nit pick as the cherry on top: the menus have these cute little animations to them that are cool at first, but become agonising when you're just trying to get through the menus quickly and have to wait for the animations to play out before you can do whatever you're trying to do. Also, a r e y o u d o u b l e c h e c k i n g t h e r e q u e s t??\n\nIf there's a sale going on and you're a die-hard lover of these characters and this world like me, this game can be worth it for just a few more hours with the phantom thieves.

A significant amount of the enjoyment I got from the game comes from watching the Phantom Thieves reunite and mess around in their tour around Japan and Jails(This game's version of Palaces). Playing around on a beach, visiting landmarks, tasting local cuisine; the characters having fun is pretty fun to watch.  Some of the characters even get some additional characterization which can range from meh to decent. \n\nOther than that? Zenkichi and Sophia are likeable additions to the team. Their respective character arcs couldn't be more predictable, but they at least get decent pay offs. It also helps that they have colourful enough personalities and designs which blend in surprisingly well with the rest of the phantom thieves.\n\nThe combat is also pretty decent, though it can get draggy if you don't make use of your skills to hasten through certain fights. \n\nThere are more negatives. The story rehashes a lot of elements from the original game's story, except most of the climatic moments didn't have the build up and pacing leading up to them to make said moments especially emotional. Conceptually, it had a lot of potential. It was just executed rather poorly. Has a few cool moments though. \n\nMost of the sidequests are so boring I wonder why they're there in the first place. \n\"Kill X Number of Y Mob with Z Character\" \n\"Collect X Number of Y Item Drop\"\n\"Revisit a boss and kill it a second time\"\n\nThat's about it really. The only thing that I can add on is that it maintains the visual flare from the original p5. All in all, it was fun and I'm glad I played it, but the game is riddled with some serious issues that makes it difficult to recommend at it's original price tag. Not to mention it's only like 20-30 hours.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "35f7ea14400a5ebdba047b4bfd81627f", "author": "a526dc33af435d15b5a73c957389d143", "date": "2023-01-31", "hours": 2344, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a spin-off set after the events of Persona 5 featuring most of the Phantom Thieves, developed in tandem with Omega Force and with significantly different gameplay to mainline Persona games.\n\nI think that the gameplay differences are ultimately a good thing because turn-based combat, as good as it is in P5, gets boring eventually so the mix-up is appreciated here. The combat is fast-paced and can be engaging, however personally it's not ideal. Whilst I like character action and hack and slash games, P5S is essentially dynasty warriors with a persona skin, and I have some issues with that.\n\nThe hordes of enemies the game throws at you regularly make it very difficult to see what is actually happening on screen, and it doesn't feel like player skill is all that important in the grand scheme of things, rather most battles are just stat checks or a test of how long your patience will last against a bullet sponge. Fortunately, the effects look pretty decent and the music is fantastic as usual - so things don't get too boring.\n\nIn terms of story, P5S does some things well; the story is fairly interesting towards the middle-end, it's nice to see more of some of the Phantom Thieves and Zenkichi is a great character addition (he reminds me how much I would love a future persona game to feature a largely adult cast). But there are also a few failings; I think the story is too similar to themes that have already been explored in Persona 5 and Royal, and for the first half-or-so of the game it is far too formulaic in it's story-telling. Ultimately, it's quite predictable, which would be fine if things weren't presented as 'twists'.\n\nI also have to say I was a bit disappointed by the absence of most of the characters that were in Persona 5 and Royal, and I feel that although it's set after Persona 5 it doesn't feel like it's a true sequel to the story.\n\nAnd one final note because this was definitely the most annoying thing throughout my playthrough... The menus look great and all but they play so many animations when switching between menus that it significantly slows down navigating them, I also found the animation that plays when entering and exiting jails is too long when you're encouraged to go in and out often. Maybe it's a bit of a nitpick but for a fast-paced action game like this, the fact that the menus are way more cumbersome to navigate than the ones in P5 gets very frustrating very quickly, especially when you forget you're not controlling Joker so you can't swap out the character you're controlling in the menu.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a nice addition to the Phantom Thieves story which has a reasonable completion time, so I recommend it if you liked Persona 5 and want to see more of the main characters.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "96ededde8137562b963ee1a6879c2858", "author": "355fff7f0b07512c99deee87e5e2f108", "date": "2023-01-30", "hours": 741, "content": "the opposite of turn based combat is turn cringe combat, the game isn't cringe though.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fd8bbf738dcf5ff2b8eee38f07913095", "author": "777c668c17e9527c9d18ff0a9aef8c51", "date": "2023-01-29", "hours": 2022, "content": "9/10\nA Awesome Sequel To Persona 5\nDynasty-like combat is fun\nGreat Ending for Phantom Thieves", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e51fabf554f3585784813592f0630877", "author": "15235b10df20542286b5ceb82ed732fd", "date": "2023-01-29", "hours": 2849, "content": "", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "423fc500d62859709210fb693768263f", "author": "62a007838c3b5674a3c49844218e1093", "date": "2023-01-29", "hours": 122, "content": "Played for about 2 hours.

It's a canon spin-off that assumes you played the base game, but it omits details from Royal. It\u2019s also a Mus\u014d game with surprising complexity and the smallest scale battles in the genre. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for Persona games to have weak beginnings and Strikers is no exception. Players are inundated with lousy tutorials and gameplay-interrupting cutscenes. It\u2019s no wonder there are numerous negative reviews complaining about the supposed difficulty of the game. To put it as inelegantly as possible: unless those reviewers were playing on Merciless, this is a colossal example of a skill issue. While the tutorial is mediocre, the onus is on the player to use every tool in the game to succeed. Once you acquire the Master Arts for each Phantom Thief, the gameplay is like flowing water. Chaining special attacks and Persona skills into All-Out attacks feels great, and there are further opportunities for skill expression. Late-game bosses can be cut down like a knife through butter by remotely competent players.\n\nThere isn't much to discuss about Strikers' story, it's more Persona 5. While the story arcs are similar and many of the villains are laughably one-dimensional, Strikers shines with its upbeat charm and flashy aesthetic. Just don\u2019t go in with hopes of a villain on par with Maruki, you\u2019ll be disappointed. \n\nStrikers has a few remaining flaws. There are frame drops during cutscenes. The tension and pacing of dungeons are nonexistent since you can leave and return with full HP and SP. Ambushing Shadows is less precise than Persona 5. There's no \u201cregister all\u201d button for the Velvet Room, and the way you purchase equipment in Sophie\u2019s shop is unnecessarily inefficient, which is baffling considering Persona 5 solved this issue back in 2016.

I would also stress again, the game makes it viable for you to play as everyone so you're not going to find yourself in a Tales situation where you can just play the game as your starting MC forever and call it a day. Overall a moderately challenging game that nudges you into trying new playing styles to keep it fresh. \n\nAs for story it was serviceable.

There is a legitimate story in this game that extends beyond the standard musou spinoff plot of \"all your favourite characters have been sucked into a non-canonical alternate universe\". It assumes that you have played through P5 all the way to the end. As such, the rest of this review will contain spoilers for P5.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is honestly a very weird game to review. It is a musou or warriors-style game that tries to cram as many P5 mechanics into a musou game as possible, and the end result is a musou game that is utterly unique, though in a way that is likely to annoy many players who are approaching this game purely from the musou perspective. However, P5 fans will see these quirks as knowing references to the original game and appreciate them nonetheless, even if the game is somewhat jankier as a result.\n\nPlot-wise, P5S picks up not long after the end of P5 (the base game, not the Royal ending). The phantom thieves meet up for summer vacation only to find that people are messing with the Metaverse once again even after they destroyed Mementos. This meddling has resulted in change-of-heart incidents all over Japan, which the police have decided to pin on the Phantom Thieves. Thus, the gang now has to go on a road trip all across Japan, solving Metaverse crimes and clearing their own name.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the writing in P5S feels like a lighter but still authentic-feeling version of what we got in P5. One interesting angle that P5S takes is that while most of the Palace rulers in P5 are straight up irredeemable villains, all of the Jail monarchs (this game's version of the Metaverse) in P5S are sympathetic people who have been wronged in one way or another and got tempted to use the powers of the Metaverse to take revenge on society. Many of them have backstories that directly challenge the beliefs of the Phantom Thieves, causing them to question how right and just their actions are. Unfortunately, while these are interesting ideas, they do not have time to develop properly due to the much shorter length of P5S, both in terms of gameplay time and in-universe calendar days. While a typical Palace in P5 might consist of two weeks of investigating the backstory of the Palace ruler, two weeks given to infiltrate the palace and steal the treasure and another two weeks to see the fallout of the change of heart and how it affects everyone, in P5S you will typically discover a Jail, learn about the ruler's backstory, perform a change of heart and move on to the next city all in less than a week.\n\nHowever, if there's one area where the writing of P5S really shines, it's in the cheerful and bubbly character interactions amongst the Phantom Thieves. If you enjoyed the many interactions between team members in P5 during the less serious moments, such as the beach day, the Hawaii trip and the cultural festival, P5S is a treasure trove of moments like that. After all, the premise of the game is a cross-country summer vacation road trip, and every new city they visit is an excuse for them to enjoy the local tourist attractions. If you're a Futaba or Haru fan especially, they have much more screentime in P5S than P5 because they're part of the starting roster right from the beginning.\n\nIn terms of battle mechanics, most of it is standard musou game fare. You have a light attack and a heavy attack, and combining them in various ways leads to various combos that have various effects like air launchers and crowd control. Every playable character also has a unique mechanic associated with them. For example, Ann can infuse her whip with fire so that her normal attacks also deal fire damage, and Ryuji can activate a stance that increases his defense and knockback resistance. The unique mechanic that P5S brings compared to other musou games is the return of elemental weaknesses and resistances from P5. You can deal elemental damage by either spending SP to cast Persona abilities as AOE damage effects, or by using certain attack combo paths that naturally end with your character summoning their Persona without using SP. Hitting a regular enemy with an elemental weakness will trigger a small all-out attack which damages all enemies in the area, while minibosses and bosses have shield icons that must be broken with elemental attacks. Breaking a single shield will lead to a one-more attack which is a bit of free damage against them, while breaking all the shields will trigger a much larger all-out attack which deals a lot of damage and leaves the boss downed for a period of time.\n\nOn one hand, I don't really mind the elemental system from an offensive standpoint. Some people complained that bosses only take chip damage from everything besides elemental attacks, but every musou game has enemies split between fodder grunts that only exist to charge your ultimate ability and actually threatening enemies that need you to focus and think for a bit. On the other hand, I really don't like the elemental system from a defensive standpoint. Like I said, in musou games you're meant to treat the hundreds of small enemies as invisible and focus on the few large enemies, but in this game the small enemies also have elemental attacks, and some of them are super-effective against your character's Persona. Getting hit by a super-effective elemental attack, even from a grunt enemy, can stun you and lead to you getting comboed to death by the miniboss, and it's impossible to keep track of every small enemy when there can be literally dozens of enemies on screen at any one time.\n\nThe pacing of the combat sections is lifted straight out of P5, which will probably annoy many musou fans. Most musou games have you running through a decently large battlefield, taking down roaming groups of enemies while prioritising specific targets according to the story. In P5S, you take down one group of enemies, then you get a cutscene explaining a new story development, then another fight, then another cutscene etc. This is basically exactly how the Palaces in P5 functioned, but this is highly atypical for a musou game and people who are not accustomed to the pacing of P5 will probably get annoyed. Also, there is a very weird and annoying quirk with the game where you are allowed to exit the Jail at various checkpoints to fully recover health and SP and go back into the Jail at the same point, it doesn't advance the calendar and there is no penalty for doing so. In fact, the game explicitly tells you that this is a legitimate tactic. In that case, why not let the checkpoint heal you directly, instead of making you wait through 2 loading screens to exit and re-enter the Jail?\n\nAlso, most of the P5 gameplay outside of dungeon-crawling has essentially been removed in P5S. The calendar system is in the game essentially in name only. There is no deadline for clearing Jails, and leaving and re-entering Jails does not advance the calendar. The calendar only advances with main story completion and the time-management aspect of P5 is no longer present. There are also no social stats for you to level up, so your time spent outside of Jails will consist mainly of buying supplies and talking to your teammates to get side quests. However, to compensate for that, all the Jails you visit will still remain accessible even after you clear them and you will revisit them to complete side quests, which is a departure from P5 Palaces.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anybody who played P5, enjoyed the interactions of the Phantom Thieves and wished that there was more of that to snack on. If you're the kind of person who loved all the vacation side stories in P5 and wished that there was a game which is 50% of just that, then this game is definitely for you. Honestly I would hesitate to recommend P5S at full price, but this game goes on pretty steep discount quite frequently and it's definitely worth picking up during a sale.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 21, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ee7676d385085cff9c963c1d38cb9862", "author": "bc08987811d45541974db25bb5bc4cd9", "date": "2023-01-20", "hours": 20, "content": "Im sure this game is great but its not playable.

Yes, the camera controls are absolutely vile, and you may need to reach near-divinity to process all the information on screen, but you get used to it pretty quick. Once you find your favorite character(s) to play and get some levels under your belt, things get a lot smoother. The story maintains the bar of quality set by Persona 5, definitely continuing its style, and the new characters that come along for the ride are a blast, and bring some unique angles to the Phantom Thieves.

However after completing this game I'm more than happy to say that this game is more than just a spin off, but a worthy sequel to the Persona 5 story and an excellent addition to the franchise. \n\nThe combat in the game at first was a challenge at first, but after getting used to the controls it felt smooth and it incorporated the core elements of Persona 5's battle system like baton bass and persona creation excellently. Each character felt like they had a unique combat style that matched their character and were all fun to use, with my favorite's being Yusuke and Zenkichi.\n\nThe story was also a strong point of the game, and the two new members of the phantom thieves, Sophia and Zenkichi, were wonderful addition to the main cast and added a lot of life to this game. The story also allowed characters that didn't get as much development in the original game to get fleshed out more, with Haru getting the most development out of any the original cast. The villains of this game had some really great boss designs and were characterized in a sympathetic light, which allowed them to act as foils and further the growth of certain members of the Phantom Thieves.  My favorite part of this game was while there was an overarching plot about freeing people from their trauma, the game also spent a lot of time on slice of life elements. It really did feel like I was on a road trip with good friends, and made me appreciate the Phantom Thieves characters that much more. \n\nThe visuals of this game are top notch and maintain the flair and art style from the original game that we all know and love. The soundtrack is phenomenal and just as good as the soundtrack from Persona 5 Royal. Lyn absolutely brings her A game to the table with all the new songs featuring her, and the remixes of songs such as Last Surprise and Blooming Villain do the originals justice.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend Persona 5 Strikers to anyone who is a fan of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal that just wants to spend some more time with the characters that many of us have come to love. It's a fantastic addition to the franchise and I hope Atlus will continue explore the world of Persona 5 in the future.  \n\nAn easy 10/10!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 33, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e531b7c0b4b25b74a3bac9a8aeff5883", "author": "7c2d7e9a81f855e6afffca652fe2a741", "date": "2023-01-11", "hours": 3794, "content": "too great to be just a sequel game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d66c1ccfc9bc5882817b25f379171e3f", "author": "588fbc9d716d541eb6197b891ce60426", "date": "2023-01-11", "hours": 2312, "content": "Persona 5 2 do be slappin", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "44e9f74e8ecd5d3f8ecb3226f067c9ff", "author": "c6c92c6ad8625bde87cafc9173de99ec", "date": "2023-01-11", "hours": 2867, "content": "Overall great follow up to P5.\nStory-wise it's a direct sequel to P5 Vanilla ending.

Buy only if you really want more Persona 5 content, and even then just try get it on a console or something.\n\nConstant crashes mixed with no autosave (???) and awkward placement of manual save points (luckily cutscenes even with chooseable dialogue options are completely skipable) , barebones support for PC graphic options, esp over 1080p/FHD.\n\nGameplay is hit or miss leaning on miss. Mixing hack n slash with normal Persona turnbased elements, like how Dynasty Warriors does it, but worse. The real time actions of the enemies makes it frustrating to use strategic skills and the hack n slash part does not feel good to play standalone (saving grace is Yusuke with his carbon copy Vergil moveset). \nTo do well in hard mode feels more like needing to grind levels and cheese skills and items you to obtain from mindless mob grinding (kill trash mobs in an area, leave the area, kill the new batch that respawned and repeat) to beat the insanely bloated HP of bosses and mini bosses; otherwise you'll be stuck in a 30 min clunky boss fight that ends prematurely because you ran out of SP and your computer friends died somewhere between the fight starting and you zoning out after watching the boss's health bar tick down at like 1% every 5 minutes. The AI teammates in your party act like basic computers reacting to enemy attacks (ironically not smart enough to be AI), yet somehow manage to still be useless to the point you have to babysit them esp on hard.\n\nStory is regular Persona business (pretty decent overall but not as good as the mainline games such as P5R, P4G, P3 etc.) but it is also completely linear and can be skipped through without missing too much (useful, because it's what I had to do after losing hours of saves multiple times). IMO it almost has ruins the impact of the story/ending Persona 5/Royal had given you, especially if you play this one right after.\n\nBanging music though, makes up for all the shortcomings.

The story is a bit predictable and has many repeated points with the original game, but some bits are really good. I'd almost say the main plotline is secondary until well past the halfway point of the game, up until that point it's basically Slice of life with dungeon crawling, and I don't mean it as a downside. The Phatom Thieves go on a vacation through Japan and it's full of hilarious moments.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the main complaint about this game since it's not turn-based, but people seem to forget this is a spin-off title developed by Tecmo Koei, and honestly as an action RPG it's very entertaining and considered to be one of the best they've developed. I found it incredibly overwhelming at the beginning with all the tutorials and characters with different playstyles, but I got used to it and appreciate that they made all characters playable, relevant and they actively encourage you to learn them.\nAlso the soundtrack is a complete banger, easily a top contender for best Persona soundtrack, put me Daredevil and Axe to Grind in a 10 hour loop and I'm a happy person.\n\nAs a side note: If you see the text blurry, disabling antialiasing fixes it.

I absolute recommend this game.\n\nFull review bellow, may cointain spoilers, I dont know.\n\nI really loved Persona 5 Strikers, not only it brought back our dear Phantom Thieves together filling that void that you get when your favorite game or show ends but it also delivered an amazing history and game.\n\nHistory\n\nI really enjoyed the history, usually Persona games are really straight foward, the bad guys are evil, the good guys bring them down, nothing wrong with that, however, in Persona 5 Strikers most of the villains arent actually evil people and its really good to see such shift from an abusive professor that beats middle schoolers and abuse them to an artist and singer consumed by sadness and sorrow doing some wrong things after obtaining an unknown power through Emma that could help them in running away from scars from the past.\n\nNot only it gave the gang a weird feeling after beating the shadow form of the villains, but they also felt so connected to the problems they were facing. Instead of having the usual hero vs villain fight to save the people, our dear Phantom Thieves wanted to help the villains aswell, since they were good people too! It was so nice to see that people could forgive people like Natsume cherishing his comeback or Mariko listening to the mother that lost his daughter saying that Mariko was really important to the city and wanted her as mayor again.\n\nWe're living times were people define you for mistakes you commited, you see on Social Media people absolutely terrorizing famous people lifes for errors they did 2? 6? years ago, ignoring that despite being famous they're humans aswell, imperfect and capable of changing. People do it to everyone nowadays, one mistake and your life is ruined.\nSo Persona 5 Strikers history brings a really important message, that not everyone that do mistakes are evil people, that people despite doing wrong things wether you forgive them or not CAN change. I really liked it, it is really important to have themes like this delivered to us.\n\nI really liked Sophia and Zenkichi, both were such well developed characters. Despite having the means to have an extensive knowledge, Zenkichi being a grown adult working for PubSec and Sophia an AI with full acess to information, both had such low knowledge of emotions and spent the whole journey learning. It was so warming to see Zenkichi coming to therms with Akane and finally facing Owada, thus, becoming a good father and a good friend to himself, no longer running away from his ideals and goals. Sophia, even though she is an AI, displayed so many emotions, everytime she interfered and spoke to villains, showing her views and ideas about what was going on, I could imagine her crying if she could, for an AI she has so much passion, its like even though she doesnt have a physical heart, it is there. She became a caring and loving friend, a true humanity companion :)\n\nIt was also nice to see how much Makoto and Haru matured, while Ryuji and Ann are still teenagers slacking their duties on school hahaha\n\nGameplay\n\nI enjoyed so much the way Atlus introduced Persona to hack n slash, it was really well done. Battling felt so satisfying with such beautiful graphics and soundtrack, the voice acting is top notch. Every character had an unique way of attacking and the way baton pass works in P5S was really well done.\nDespite having so much fun, there are things I believe it could be done diferently.\n\nSince the battles are so action packed and fast, having an image show every time you attack the enemy weakness not only becomes a visual polution but it also decrease the value that it had on previous Persona Games. It is so satisfying to see an image pop up with a close face of your character when you crit in Persona 4, it didnt feel that satisfying having the close up every time you attack the enemy weakness, sometimes it felt like it was delaying the battle and I know I just felt this way because the image showed every time. The close-up face image should only show sometimes, I suppose in future hack'n'slash games, Persona magic abilities could crit too and therefore the image would only show if the ability landed a crit? I dont know.\n\nI am grateful that the commands arent a mess for keyboard users, I had no problem playing this game on keyboard and could enjoy it's full experience despite not having a controller. I dont think its a flaw, its just an opinion, but, I wish they changed the default key for guns, it felt weird to use ctrl key + shift for charged shots and sometimes I accidentaly pressed the windows key, also, it was difficult to leave the Gun mode when using Sophia due to the keys being so far away. Maybe its a problem in my end, who knows.\n\nSoundtrack + Voice Acting\n\nAmazing as always, Persona games always deliver good music and this game is no exception! The new versions of musics used in Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal are REALLY good, I couldnt image that such good tracks could be improved since they were already good, but they improved them a lot to fit this game! Keeper of Lust in Persona 5 Strikers is such a banger, congratulations!\nAlso, thanks Atlus for possibility of choosing old Persona games battle musics, it was such cool addition, I really loved it.\n\nThe voice actings was perfect! There were so many emotional moments that would NEVER be as good as they are if the dub wasnt so well done! Yusuke telling Natsume to dont lump Sayuri with the soulless history that he wrote, Sophia and Ichinose/Konoe, Ryuji telling Emma to shut up when she was telling bad things to Sophia. So many good moments.\n\nAhh I feel like playing again just by remembering those moments haha, Persona 5 had such a good dub and Persona 5 Strikers keeps the tradition.\n\n-----\n\nThanks to everyone involved in the production of this game, it is really an amazing game and I felt so happy while playing it.\nThere are so many good things to write about Persona 5 Strikers that would make my review so big, but in short, thank you very much for creating such cool game for my favorite series!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "50f84bd467be5008bf3b384d14b4d319", "author": "af6c21d3d89152b3911b5c6d08140527", "date": "2022-12-31", "hours": 3511, "content": "summary get this if you finished persona 5 or royal.\n\nthis game is a p5/p5r base setting with changed battle system and also social system since the story set after p5 ending which you suppose to max confidant with all your friend. story wise still the same p5 vibe so if you like p5 you like this as well.\n\nas for gameplay most ppl think this is a warrior like gameplay with p5 skin, while truth is its persona/smt series base system but changed to warrior like battle style with it p5 battle adaption such as weakness/all out attack/baton pass/show time etc... it start out kinda difficult when you dont understand the game or you are not action game player, but as you play and understand the system more you feel the p5 adaption is on point. \n\noverall while the game is far from perfect but it put in effort to try new stuff instead of just skin change. maybe it will be better next adaption if there any.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bab14089936f53d79e867fdb225c645f", "author": "616275d0cf51549a8a72f7a1026408cd", "date": "2022-12-30", "hours": 33, "content": "Persona 5 Royal was amazing, great story, ran with no issues.

I initially posted my review at the 37h mark (around 3/4 of the story) but felt compelled after I've finished the game to make the review more complete, in order to do it justice - because the game went from being pretty good at first to being great when I was technically done with it. \n\nIt should be noted that P5S appears to be the canonical sequel to Persona 5 (P5), so if you're the type that needs to follow stories in chronological order, you might want to pass on this game for now. Personally, I've yet to play P5 myself although I do have some background having watched the awful Persona 5: The Animation before. If you have no background of P5, some names and terminology that come up in the game might leave you confused but I don't think they are a huge issue. And if you're invested in the story thereafter, then all the more reason to pick up Persona 5 Royal (P5R) - the definitive version of P5 also available on Steam - when you're done with P5S.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, other titles in the Musou genre (which I'll refer to as \"Musous\") are laid out in mission stages where the combat field (the stage itself) involves mowing down hordes of enemies while completing set objectives - visceral large-scale combat on an open field while being outnumbered and yet overpowered. However, P5S's game structure is that of a JRPG and is an authentic Persona experience. Instead of stages, P5S uses JRPG dungeons (known here as \"jails\") which become available as the story progresses. When encountering an enemy (or via scripted events) in dungeons, it will usually spawn a horde of enemies - this is where the Musou-influence comes into play. If you're familiar with Persona series, just think of the turn-based combat being replaced by action combat. There are some minor platforming/puzzle-solving in various dungeons which I didn't appreciate but they do add variety. Outside dungeons, you hang around in a designated open city like those in the Yakuza series except there's no fighting to be had. There are side quests in the game (known as requests) which are mostly kill/fetch quests - nothing super interesting but aren't annoying either. In terms of content, there's the main story comprising of a few dungeons. Finishing the story will allow you to make a clear save to access post-game content which comes in the form of requests to obtain the best weapons for your team. Finishing the post-game content will then allow you to start NG+ which also unlocks the highest difficult, \"Merciless\". In NG+, everything you previously earned is carried over. There are a total of 9 playable characters and 8 of them are accessible from the start of your first \"non-tutorial\" dungeon while the 9th will join later in the story. In NG+, you can access all 9 in the first actual dungeon.\n\nCombat is one area the game shines in and caters to various styles of play. The controls in the game are responsive and all the Persona mechanics are very well integrated into the combat. Your attacks are made up by strings of basic attacks ending with a special attack. In addition, you have a dodge that has invincibility frames and can invest points in perks later on to capitalize on perfect dodges. If you're not a fan of fast-paced action, there's also a dedicated button to access your personas and also freezes time. There's also access to Persona fusion like any other Persona games. Different personas have different (but fixed) effects at the end of their combo strings, so finding a good mix of skills that work well alongside the combo strings is what the substance of build-making is - figuring out what skills are good and the fusion path to inherit the skills you want, to the target persona to fuse. In P5S, skills learnt by personas (i.e. not inherited from fusion) are always remembered and can be reconfigured when out of combat. The party size is up to 4 and members can be changed when out of combat, with the main restriction that Joker (the main protagonist) must always be in the team. So if you want to go at it alone, you can do so but only with Joker. All characters have a different play style and you can swap to any party (not team) member during combat. Progression takes the form of levels/equipment, persona roster, character-specific arts and a bond board which is used to unlock team-wide perks. Combat may initially feel plain and restrictive due to low SP gauge for abilities but gets better with game progression as characters learn new skills and from unlocking perks at the bond board. Although Musous tend to have a bad rep for being no-brainer button-mashers, P5S isn't quite the case and you can play it as a skill-based game by not abusing consumables, which will be in short supply anyway unless you grind for them. Boss fights are especially fun.\n\nThe story is pretty decent and the storytelling really shines here - compared to Persona 5 - which is helped by the good writing, overall presentation and a focus on bonding events. The dialogues are mostly full voiced and the English dub is pretty good. The script is well-written and there's a lot of humour which the voice actors did a really good job delivering. The story cutscenes and non-action-related gameplay takes up like 50% of the game, so if you're invested in the story, then it's great; if not, the game will feel like a beefed up visual novel with sparse but lengthy action gameplay in-between. While I did enjoy the story conversations, one gripe I have with it is that there's a lot of repeated info which feels like intentional padding rather than real value to the overall plot. For Persona fans specifically, there aren't any social links here and literally zero consequences to player choice. However, there are many bonding events that do a terrific job of fleshing out the friendship of the protagonists - like in Persona 4 Golden (P4G). P5 was disappointing to me story-wise, but P5S pretty much redeemed it for me - in fact, I prefer its story-telling over the former.\n\nPresentation is top notch in pretty much every Persona game I know of (since Persona 3) and this one is no slouch either. The UI is sleek and stylish while remaining usable. Combat looks amazingly flashy and feels good to pull off combos/abilities. My only gripe with the visuals is that the UI clutter can make fights with a lot of enemies difficult to read. The music was initially only serviceable for me, but did grew on me over time. I really like the themes in the dungeons of the later half and the remixes of the original Persona 5 tracks, like \"Blooming Villain\" and \"Keeper of Lust\". The track during the last phase of the final boss fight, \"Demiurge II: Negai\" was truly exceptional; it so well orchestrated with the last fight that it elevates it beyond epic - I think it's right up there with \"Ameno Sagiri\" (P4G), if not better. Most of these are arranged/composed by the Koei Tecmo Sound team, I believe.\n\nPerformance-wise, I'm happy to report that I didn't encounter any technical issues in the entirety of my 90+ hours playtime. Game runs great and loads fast on my AMD 2700X/GTX1060 6GB setup even when installed on a spinning HDD.\n\nIn conclusion, I've thoroughly enjoyed P5S and would strongly recommend it even at its asking price. It has a decent story that is well delivered and has a good amount of content going for it. The action combat is fun and caters well to players looking for simplicity or depth. As for replayability, it depends on how much you get tired of replaying the storyline over and over. But that's what I'm doing right now in NG+ merciless.

The \"issues\" I ran into at the start are subjective, you get to use all of the characters at the start and there is a lot to learn, not to mention playing on Hard difficulty made it difficult for me to progress until I got the hang of some mechanics as I was getting destroyed so it was mostly my fault.\n\nThe game is difficult only if you're unsure of what you're doing, as you get through the game and learn combos, how to manage your resources and what's important, it becomes much easier.\n\nWhat makes the game diluted is that the jails are less in-depth than palaces and there are no confidants, so it is a much more streamlined experience with fewer things to tie you to the story and characters emotionally, though the original in a way did that for you already.\n\nThe combat itself is in my opinion superior to the turn-based version because of the depth, you can control 4 characters at once with Joker being the wild card (being able to use multiple personas), and each character has their own combos including mechanics like dodging, parries and perfect dodges. As you learn these things you'll be able to handle most things in the game with ease.\n\nThe story, while not on par with vanilla's, is still good despite being slow for the first two or three jails, after that point the entire progression of jails changes and everything flows much more smoothly. It really does feel like a sequel (because it is) and not some spin-off, it is perfect if multiple playthroughs of the original games don't cut it anymore. What holds it back a bit is that the stakes are noticeably smaller, or to put it differently, since the Phantom Thieves are no longer newbies, saving the world only feels like a road trip and not a struggle for survival like it did in the original games.\n\nThe music for me PERSONALLY is less consistently good but when comparing it to P5's music standards it is still really good, I simply have more memorable soundtracks in the original comparing to Strikers.\n\nThe game has a post-game with beefed up bosses and some new content, as I am writing this I haven't yet tried this content but I intend to clear it, I went from feeling uneasy whenever I thought about struggling to welcoming the challenge now that I know how to approach the gameplay.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and I would implore every Persona 5 fan to try it, I really hope there will be more Persona 5 media in the future because despite playing Vanilla and Royal multiple times, saying goodbye again still stings.\n\n8.5/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "39d1ee6e08545496b97868fc787c7082", "author": "a8d1a66a9c8d598f995b0f1590ac9552", "date": "2022-12-21", "hours": 172, "content": "bigger abomination than third semester", "comments": 4, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "00fb8dc55cad587f81314d9e8e60caab", "author": "d95af3514fed5c6c808d78b01bcba7f8", "date": "2022-12-21", "hours": 4578, "content": "need more P5 game for P5 music :3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4306bf33b2f55d55aaa1b32499c56f97", "author": "3b16ea407cb95fac8b1c00931d5893de", "date": "2022-12-20", "hours": 251, "content": "Pretty damn good ngl", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4fa826a9d1e65c51bbbfdfb4b6c6c98b", "author": "3b64d7c0fd6d5538b019a2f488a326f8", "date": "2022-12-19", "hours": 189, "content": "I can't stress enough that this game has too many fucking tutorials at the start of the game.

I wanted to write an early review of what i thought about the game if anyone else was on the fence of getting it so i played for about 6 hours to get a general feel, before going in i knew there wasn't social links and i was fine with that but if your looking for that kinda stuff its not here really\n\nNow this review is from the stand point of having never played a musou game but i can say this game is very fun for me it might be terrible from a mosou veterans stand point but honestly your probably only playing this if your a fan of persona in the first place\n\nAs a disclaimer I played with a controller since the MK controls seemed awful \nThe combat is real time all out brawls while being surrounded by shadows but the actual combat boils down to basically pressing X and then Y for a finisher which is usually your personas ability which is FREE to do without SP. Which is amazing because SP drains fast in this game if your manually casting spells. And this game lets you play as any of the phantom thieves (besides akechi and yoshizawa) i found my self playing more as the other characters then Joker but i mostly played ryuji so i could dream of punt kicking that stupid cat into outer space. Each character has a very unique fighting style and move set (idk about morgona i haven't touched him) that encompass their persona,gun and melee weapons into their rushes and attacks ruji can charge up his attacks and his base Y makes him harder to flinch Ann and mokoto can imbue their weapons with their personas elements yusuke has parries and haru has massive aoes. There's also two new persona users shown off in the games opening cut scene one joined the phantom thieves at the first hour of game play and she uses yoyos shes pretty fun but there's another guy i saw using a persona in the opening cut scene of the game idk if he joins or is an antagonist though \n\nIf you played P5R you probably blew through the game without much trouble besides that dam space palace. So I came into this game expecting it to be easy so i cranked the difficulty up to hard and I was very wrong, It was actually hard for me even on normal to my surprise. Still i only have 6 hours so maybe this is just early game woes mixed with having never played a mosou before\n\nAnother point is that the game pretty much mandates a day 1 clear. To my surprise you could leave the palace and time wont progress at all, so i would drain my SP and HP leave buy some healing fuse personas ECT come back and be ready to go.\n\nOne Con i have so far is that characters that are not being played by you do not receive master arts XP which isn't to bad for the 4 people you really like considering you'll be using them often. but if you go against a boss say weak to nuclear and fire but don't use Ann or Mokoto at all your kinda outa luck because not only are they under leveled for not being in the party but they also dont have all their master arts compared to your main 4. so far this has been my only gripe with the game", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "29e7eeb3fc1a525e960ba660274b169f", "author": "7aedaf72c074591ebe67d4f077964f47", "date": "2022-11-24", "hours": 202, "content": "once you get used to the movement this game is amazing, highly recommend you pick it up but you play it after royal to get the full appreciation of it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "037d2dac42c85e8082e930045d581ff0", "author": "a448a636302f567c82552133d3b435a2", "date": "2022-11-24", "hours": 1331, "content": "Suprising a really good sequel despite the genre change, I recommend playing this even if your not a fan of dynasty warriors for the story", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "83033a9776a55bcbb077957cb7130dec", "author": "788f1c10b17954a5ad3899cbbc4f2d73", "date": "2022-11-23", "hours": 995, "content": "Ugh.... I guess I'll review it. I loved P4G and P5R as the first disclaimer, and I'm not much for JRPGs. So this is the hack and slash \"sequel\" to P5. And I don't hate it? I'm not sure if I like it because it's P5 content or how it plays (despite it taking two attempts to get into it). If you really, really want more from the P5 Story go for it. If Japanese hack and Slash are your thing... go for it. If you are just coming to terms that you might have a thing for JRPGs.... I dunno... try it out. It's not bad just very, very different. And it is disconnected from the canon in the weirdest ways. Most of that can be explained that it got made at the same time as P5R by a different Studio and they had no idea. All in all it's a P5 hack and Slash that furthers the story and it has no technical faults. So i guess I recommend it but tbh I am not sure if I like this game or not.... Which you probably experience as well.\n\nWell I'm done with the game, \"For real\" this time. I have to say, that while the Gameplay didn't do it for me, I'd happily play through it again. Because as disconnected the story is from P5R, it's entirely good on it's own. There are more moments that moved me to tears, which is kinda hard to do, than there were in P5R.

The art style, the voices, the designs - I fell in love quickly. Upon playing Joker in Smash, I eventually bought Persona 5, and then Persona 5 Royal, and then I bought this.\n\n   Initially, I was so into it. The fast-paced Koei Tecmo ARPG combat was thrilling, with the banger arrangement of remade battle themes from Persona 5. The return to where I spent easily over 300 hours between Persona 5 and 5R, and meeting the cast again.\n\n   At some point, I believe around the middle of the game, I found myself starting to dislike it. To the extent that I actually had to set a motivator for myself to finish it. I made a bet with my coworker that I would give him $100 if he finishes the re-release of P5R on PC before I finish Strikers. That's how sluggish I was, pacing-wise. After returning to the game, I found that I was just under-leveled, and maybe had the difficulty too high. I'm not really experienced with these ARPGs.\n\nThere are some segments that are a bore compared to the fast-paced gameplay in the first palace. I didn't like the segments where I had to blindly walk around open areas and talk to NPCs to hear generic dialogue about what's going on, just to progress the story. This being said, those segments are brief, and the rest of the game forward makes that part of the game worth playing through.\n\n   If you've played Persona 5 or 5R like I have, you'll definitely want to play this game. Maybe it won't be your style of gameplay, and maybe it'll take you a while. I don't regret my 43 hours with this game.

With the crew on summer vacation, Persona 5 Strikers will have you travel all over to figure out what is happening and redeem the hearts of those imprisoned at the center of this crisis. Unlike other games in the series, the gameplay is hack-and-slash, closer to Koei Tecmo's series, Dynasty Warriors, but paired with the Persona charm, it fits near perfectly. Outside of combat, you will walk around the cities and get closer to your friends while talking to them with this road trip vibe. In the end, the game is definitely an awesome and worthy successor to Persona 5.\n\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nOn the Steam Deck however, there are a couple of issues stopping me from enjoying this game. First, the game will only run when using Proton GE, so you will need to make sure it is installed (you can follow our guide on getting it on our website). Next, while it can run at higher graphics settings, I noticed there was still some slowdown. The game can definitely hit 60 FPS, but even when set to it, it caps itself around 58. To fix this, make sure to turn Vsync off as this will push it lower.\n\nThe last one is that cutscenes will only play music, not any sound effects or voices. There is subtitles so it is still passable, but it does ruin the experience a little bit if trying to fully immerse yourself. No Proton GE layer seemed to fix this, so if you are going to play on the Steam Deck, cutscenes will be impaired.\n\nOverall, the game is still very playable and can run on the Deck, but there are some caveats. The game is a lot of fun, but with the cutscene issues, it tends to break immersion a little bit. But if you can look past this, you will find a solid experience that continues one of the best JRPGs ever made!\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 20, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1ff32f62234e5f0cbcccb6bf652a9255", "author": "e5b976260ee75e8a94f75c3093bf6315", "date": "2022-10-20", "hours": 73, "content": "I really don't get this game or any game in the Persona series.\n\nYakuza series all the way.", "comments": 6, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "432f4ee2d13454aab55f4a4afc5896a4", "author": "10750e54320b590e866d6ef388358a87", "date": "2022-10-19", "hours": 3884, "content": "[h1] Sophia is Humanity's Companion!(Best AI!) [/h1]\n\nAfter finishing it...I felt empty in a feeling of reflection, I put a song on while thinking about it, weeks later I managed to gather my thoughts,\u00a0AT LEAST FOR ME although the game has a linear single ending, the experience which i received of it is the following:*minor to none spoilers ahead*\n\nThis month we had Brazilian Children's Day, why am I talking about this? The overall plot revolves around the childhood trauma of two of the characters. And the way P5S\u00a0approaches the moral theme of trauma lives up to the series' legacy,\u00a0the way it handles and showcases how to deal with childhood trauma. \n\nI reminded myself, regardless of our age, we will always have an inner child, or at least memories from our childhood that profoundly influence our overall mindset. So I loved Strikers Plot, despite the switch from RPG to ARPG, I still recommend it as a good Persona game.\n\nP.S: I recommend getting the deluxe edition for older fans, the music pack\u00a0 playing in the game with all the music from the previous games in the background ringin' gave a\u00a0\u00a0little nostalgic\u00a0feeling, well worth the extra$.\u00a0\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n- Music\n- Crosswheel weapons (Rarely do you see this in games+it's in the best char=sophie)\n- Zenkichi... relatable char, it's the closest to my usual moral, it was quite an experience watching him grow... he also uses BIG SWORDS \"ZWEIHANDER\"... (literally me in the soul series)[most unique moveset ingame battles]\n\u00a0- Cooking and dialogues, the overall camping trip.\n- I liked the fact that in this persona we didn't have a villain that was purely evil, just people with twisted goals.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nGrind,grind,grind,grind,grind,grind,grind,grind... i think grind. Well...did i say grind? Oh yeah, grind!\u00a0\n\n[h1]Final note[/h1]\u00a0 \n- I would rate the story a 10/10 but the gameplay around 6/7 so I'd give it an 8 for overall fun.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858930656", "comments": 11, "source": "steam", "helpful": 32, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "aee31497f4a85696919519ac7f7d51c0", "author": "f3ca68f36bd05cb983d0c34b53aa04f0", "date": "2022-10-18", "hours": 657, "content": "I got stuck on a request in the metaverse but have no idea how to get there, so obviously I gave up and played Persona 5 Royal instead.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "23f917d072d850d7b83afd026374b483", "author": "23de8aa0eb425626ac35d58c4c213e17", "date": "2022-10-18", "hours": 3934, "content": "The game's great.

I'd say if you loved Persona 5, you will find a lot of enjoyment here. If you are a newbie to the series, I'd say maybe read up a little bit on the story as its a lot to take in without prior knowledge! I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes beat em' ups and JRPGs.

As a fan of Persona 5 Royal, and having never played a hack and slash before, I thought I'd give this a go. As a preemptive warning, this game does spoil the ending of Persona 5, so play that first. Combat can get repetitive as with any game if you play it for long enough, but the Persona flair adds a lot to the combat. The only part I dislike is they bumped the SP cost of every skill in the game compared to its Royal price, and so that made it much harder to regenerate that SP, so you will need to leave dungeons pretty often. Luckily, since this is a spin-off, there's no calendar system to deal with, so it won't affect game play in any meaningful way other than a loading screen. Other people also claim that they are running into performance issues, but I've never noticed any major stuttering or lag at all, and while my PC isn't super low end, it's 100% not high end.

Neither of those are present in this story sequel, which means that there are no real consequential decisions for the player to make. Perhaps due to the game taking place over the course of a Summer road trip, there is no threat of a ticking clock over the player's head. You can go to and from the Jails (this game's version of the Palaces) as much as you like, which means there is no consequence to leaving to refill your SP. Thus, the choice of risking pushing deeper into the dungeon on low SP versus leaving early at the cost of time doesn't exist anymore.\n\nThe confidants are replaced by the BOND upgrade tree, which focuses on the friendship you build with the other Phantom Thieves throughout the game. It's as fine as any other upgrade tree in any modern game, but unlike Persona 5 the choices you make don't really matter. You'll have almost everything by the end of the game outside of the raw stat boosts and the biggest additions to it will come from events that happen during the main plot anyway. The confidants added side stories that you were incentivized to see through to the end on top of getting interesting new abilities. BOND is just lacking by comparison.\n\nBut, with that said, as somebody who likes action RPGs I still had fun playing the game. It does a good job of making Persona's combat fit into an action system, with trash enemies being easy to dispatch with some attack strings, but the actual demons requiring you to take advantage of their weaknesses to dispatch them efficiently. Naturally there are less playable characters here than a regular Musou game would have, but they all have their unique quirks that make them fun to play in their own right. The story is interesting enough, even if it does start to feel a little like a rehash towards the end. It should be noted that the story of Strikers follows the original ending for Persona 5, and not the ending of Royal. The music is as great as ever, although part of that is due to the game using remixes of certain songs from the original Persona 5 (Counter Strike and Daredevil are absolutely bangers though).\n\nThe game also ran on my Windows 10 PC with no problems whatsoever. It's always nice to play a PC game that doesn't waste your time with having to fix it, or having to wait for the developers to patch it to an acceptable state. It just worked.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're desperate for one last adventure with the Phantom Thieves, don't mind going from a turn-based battle system to a realtime action one and don't mind the loss of confidants or the time management, then you'll have a good time here.\n\nRecommended", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74a5981370c95470b1c82cfce58530ee", "author": "8172c5b16b2c5299b1634cefa7916b76", "date": "2022-08-28", "hours": 269, "content": "You'll never see it comiiiiiiiiiiiiing!!\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 38, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "386965d415805ef08dcc83223bee130b", "author": "9e3e8aeebd215f80bce1d5157f9b47d0", "date": "2022-08-28", "hours": 1934, "content": "Niche game for Persona 5 fans that likes Hack&Slash or just accept gameplay suffering for the MAIN story. Can't recommend to anyone who doesn't complete at least P5. H&S mechanics are fine, but I didn't like them (still better then dancing games). Game definitely lacks polishing and not on par as P5R. Mapping multiple actions on a same button will take you in unwanted situations at least a few times per game, Vertical gameplay just purely bad implements with slow camera, jumps and ropes.\nFighting are OK, but pre-combat scenes are fucked: you enter an empty room, Futaba calls that it's clear on here radars and enemy just raises from nothing and starts talking to you. Why? Just shut-up and fight me, ok? We both know that we can't talk this out. This happens so often that you will get in a big empty room knowing that an enemy will be there. This annoys me from the start and till the end.\nI didn't like \"original\" P5 remix soundtrack from the start. I bought Legacy BGM pack just to add more battle music and don't listen to this.

There isn't even really an element present here that feels wholly great or wholly terrible either, it's a balancing act where every idea is on the cusp of either entirely falling off the deep end or being something truly inspired that gets the game as a whole to stand out from the original Persona 5. I'd even go as far as saying that if this game were about 10 hours shorter that I'd think it was an outright great little time, but as it stands, the longer things went on, the more the initially small flaws would build up until it created something that I barely could bother finishing.\n\nTransforming Persona 5's core combat from the more traditional turn based combat into a musou was definitely a creative decision that I was initially concerned about since there have been so many instances where a lot of the strategy a game could have ends up getting removed in favour of button mashing, but it's honestly the thing I think Strikers ended up doing the best as I went on. Despite being a musou by definition, with the hack n slash combat paired with waves of usually very weak enemies, I was impressed by just how much of the dynamics of Persona were still present. While the basic hacking and sladhing will get you through a lot of the smaller encounters, against anything with even a hint of challenge to it, it immediately feels as if it plays a bit closer to a real time Persona rather than a standard game of the genre, with careful team building and full exploitation of enemy weaknesses both playing a huge role in getting you to the stage where you can take things down. To still provide such a strong incentive to be spending like, 20 minutes at a time in the velvet room to minmax your team and make that time feel worth it is very cool to do when the gameplay style takes such a sharp turn and it leads to some situations that really do feel frenetic, yet rewarding.\n\nThis is especially true for the boss fights, which were consistently some of the best parts here, often being on the far more tanky side of things, but always feeling as if they properly took advantage of the genre shift and all made for some engaging and intense fights that would more often than not come down to the wire, the final boss especially mixing things up in clever ways that I won't spoil. Adding those additional flashy moves that could be kited around was also a good move in making the choice to move in this direction feel warranted and meaningful while providing another avenue to provide some additional spectacle to things, keeping up with the theme of everything about Persona 5 being so incredibly flashy. That said, things aren't quite perfect either with the shift in style, with certain ideas getting lost in the process. MP conservation might as well not be a thing considering how much more health everything seems to have in this, you're going to either be staying at full MP or blowing it all in a single bigger fight, and it hinders such a core strategic element that could've been fixed just by giving the party way more or it instead of making it a resource that was even more finite than it was in the original game.\n\nThe dungeon design was also really bad for the most part, starting off with a couple that were really fun in one way or another, albeit pretty bland from a layout standpoint, but as things went on, rather than building upon concepts that were established and knowing when to add a little twist to them to elevate the experience to the next level, it just was more of the same, but more of it, and far more formulaic. This reached a peak with the 6th dungeon, which was a genuinely agonising experience because of how much unadulterated tedium was thrown towards the player. This sense of repetition carries over to the narrative as well, as while I love the vibes of the phantom thieves going on a road trip and saving the world in the process, after a certain point it becomes increasingly obvious just how many story beats have just been taken from the original and veeeerrry slightly retooled, just with character writing that feels far heavier on the tropes.\n\nIn general there's a certain impersonal feel to how a lot of the narrative is executed, villains that are barely connected with the protagonists in any way beyond vague similarities in their strife, everyone just doing their own thing and happening to cross paths along the way, and basically any other interaction outside of the main cast. While this definitely works in some instances to make the world feel more alive and not something that entirely revolves around the protagonists, it quickly leads to wishing that the game would've at least used this in a more creative way at the very least. These 2nd hand stories of hardship and trauma you hear throughout are obviously still pretty dark and all, but without basically any contextualisation to these beyond the bare minimum, it ends up leaving a very minimal impact in comparison and makes it hard to truly get invested in the antagonists throughout, often feeling explicitly introduced to cause conflict without any other purpose.\n\nThe lack of this personal element extends out to the rest of the game too, gone is the sense of proper time progression and planning, instead replaced with the game's date exclusively moving forward when the plot demands it rather than leaving any leniency for one of the best aspects of the original game. Things just have nowhere near as much of a comfy charm when you're not spending a lot of your time just, living life and chatting with characters, and not only are all the side characters from the original not present at all, but the social links or any equivalent are also missing. All of this is replaced with this one bar called the \"bond bar\" which is just an artificial way of trying to evoke the same feelings without putting in any of the elements that elevated this, and like so many other elements just feels like it was included to keep up the surface level similarities. Funnily enough though, despite all my complaints, a lot of this only started becoming truly detrimental near the end once things began to outstay their welcome, and even amongst this painful end portion, the final boss was still a really great time and there were a few other isolated elements of greatness mixed in, not to mention that the game was almost as stylish as the original, albeit less polished.\n\nI genuinely feel like if you're more used to games on the longer side of things that you'll get more out of this than I did, as I'll admit that I do begin running out of patience after a certain point and it probably makes some of the issues present here feel even worse than they are in reality. Still won't affect my own opinion, but I could definitely see others enjoying this more than me as a result. If you're a big fan of Persona 5 and are fine with a bit of repetitiveness, I could definitely recommend this, it still maintains a very high amount of P5's identity while taking things in a different direction. It's not perfect, but you get to see more Phantom Thieves in action and Haru finally is able to get a reasonable amount of screentime too, and that stuff combined with the surprisingly fun combat ends up making this an alright time even if I personally ended up feeling pretty disappointed and bored towards the end.\n\n6.5/10 - Recommended but only if you're a pretty big fan of the OG Persona 5 and wait for it to go on sale", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2477a946814451cf8623468c3265a89d", "author": "9bec7ac055da5a10a681329eff819592", "date": "2022-08-26", "hours": 4803, "content": "After coming from Royal, the story felt kind of predictable and unsatisfysing, but that's not to say it's bad.

The satisfying nature or the combos, the insane nuance of the movement and master arts, and the adjustment of the persona mechanics all combine to create an extremely sturdy gameplay cycle with a very high skill ceiling for each of the 8 playable characters.\nover the course of the base game, even in hard difficulty I rarely felt like the challenge gave the combat enough justice, but merciless difficulty was a whole different story. Being NG+ exclusive, of course merciless would be difficult but holy shit, some of the bosses put dark souls to shame (although i would've liked the boss to not take an hour and a half).\nI can't put all my thoughts into this one review because steam won't let me, so I'll conclude with my recommendation: you should play base P5 before this but it isn't a requirement, hard mode is the only difficulty with any challenge until NG+, and if the combat hooked you then I'd highly recommend merciless, but this game is best enjoyed with full context and played at your own pace.\n10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f400d5e4f9ec5c77a8916fc315a71b44", "author": "e043ee0d8073545983d9bcc0232bae59", "date": "2022-08-25", "hours": 812, "content": "I tried to like it but the gameplay wasn't for me...", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eefcaec4ad675ab1bf53748d6f307b65", "author": "11ea491209595bb5831651168d47fecf", "date": "2022-08-25", "hours": 2209, "content": "persona 5 lite with a worse story for an already bad story. however this is the only persona game that lets me run around as ryuji so there's something to be said there", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "99fb6d848b16530492fba4604ac383d0", "author": "e3739556d6b151f7898f218563e70a2d", "date": "2022-08-25", "hours": 674, "content": "Really good game but will make you motion sick at times so be careful", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "75e945e5da6a5a58a6b4e8ff2e9a86a9", "author": "e8e810c32d245fdbafab494820cf1b94", "date": "2022-08-18", "hours": 3598, "content": "Joker's voice saying persona", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7929b1eed67552779dc5fb18dc8d28d6", "author": "24a4661dcb7e5992b60379067c052bea", "date": "2022-08-17", "hours": 2449, "content": "average musou game but persona", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "12beedd5947f537792e75ad531cf4efc", "author": "0567499d01bd5a208b8ef77fd324665c", "date": "2022-08-17", "hours": 254, "content": "I wonder what ren/jokers pee smells like.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f28145fe00b051b49f8d695248aa5af3", "author": "5f49b65aa5b75564aed78fc0656ab00c", "date": "2022-08-16", "hours": 1438, "content": "unplugging a controller makes the game crash, so yeah good port", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5998ec61f68755b592394d9ca6672033", "author": "3de6df114a9d51b98dd40fc3dde9af1a", "date": "2022-08-15", "hours": 3831, "content": "MORE PERSONA!!! @ALTUS @SEGA", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "53f3d57231a852a49e6f7faaed947afd", "author": "b3b10afe321856839dc85f74e617053e", "date": "2022-08-15", "hours": 4495, "content": "I love the Persona games - especially Persona 5 (both original and Royal).

Its a huge turn off from the exceedingly fun fast pace hack n slash and then cut to 3 - 10 minutes of dialogues at each checkpoint.\n\nThe writing is not great either, no character development for any of the past members and cheap forced sympathy for the villains. There was tons of needless dialogue, dialogue that could've been summed up in a sentence. Instead they make like 3-5 members of the phantom thieves to give some sort of dialogue reaction like \"we're stuck\", \"oh no\", \"what are we going to do\". But to give credit where its due, Zenkichi's arc and Sophia's are my favourite standouts. \n\nGameplay is fun, the typical 'Warriors' type combat with Persona element mixed in and provided mindless enjoyment. The Jails (Dungeons) are linear, boring and mixed with the unnecessary forced dialogue at each checkpoint. It gave this dynamic of clearing enemies for fun and then cut to boring dialogue that last for minutes. The Jails were visually appealing but annoying to play through with lots of backtracking and downtime like unnecessary dialogue and defending Futuba for 3 minutes to move to the next area. The bossfights were fun though, each one had their own mechanic that provided decent challenge and having the option to fight them again.\n\nThis is not a must play game, at best your looking at a Marvel movie level of enjoyment in this game.

But even with the weak story early on it's still fun, and the story does get really good(albeit being a bit too similar to the original).

If you don't particularly like Persona, though, you won't find a good Warriors/Musou game here, and if you aren't that familiar with Persona's gameplay mechanics, you also won't find a helpful introduction to them here. Incidentally, I don't have notifications on, so I don't really care if you agree or not; I'm being honest, as a big fan of Musou and someone who vastly prefers other MegaTen spin-offs.\n\nRyuji is one of the only remotely sympathetic characters, and most of the rest are varying degrees of awful and insufferable. Naturally, the one kind of likeable character gets treated like dirt by most of the rest of them. Not that they have much empathy for any other living thing, however, as evidenced by Yuusuke's insane soliloquy near the end of the second venue. This also ironically tries to make the others seem like good friends, even though that's never once evident in the game itself.\n\nNot that they miss any opportunity to talk, at length, about everything. Sometimes it's kind of charming and can even be a little helpful, in battle when one might mention the weakness of an enemy. Most of the time, it's something you want to fast-forward through or skip. You have multiple options in most conversations you're involved in, but you usually only get to chime in once or twice, and it doesn't really matter what you say that much, either. It \"but thou must!\"s all the way. Most of the time, if you get a few options, it's \"horrible person\", \"more plausibly deniable but still horrible\", and \"seems sensible but skews horrible-ish thanks to the railroading happening in most of the game\".\n\nOne of the game's best parts is how it creates some interesting places to see and fills them with things to do. Unfortunately, it doesn't really immerse you in the location, aside from some superficial traits, and the areas you can walk around in are extremely small. You seem unable to revisit places you've been, aside from the tiresome and fairly homogenous jail/palace/whatever they're calling them environments, which isn't really that exciting. Most of the layouts of these places are confusing, but not in a challenging or fun way, and the themes end up looking a lot alike, so it becomes easy to get disoriented. You'll also probably not be able to finish one in a single attempt, and additionally, some enemies give no indication of how powerful they are, so you might mop the floor with them, or they might one-shot you, which is super fun, let me tell you.\n\nYou also can't just pause and exit the game if you get yourself into a fight you either don't want to finish or know you're going to lose, so you have to just shut it down instead. This discourages you from ever taking any risks or exploring, which seems to be a poor decision in game design. Sometimes things happen that are either impossible to avoid, despite what the game indicates, or just not well explained and thus annoying, like the invisible platforms, which I regard as one of the laziest things in any game.\n\nOther elements, like the shallow cooking one and local cuisine, are intriguing at first, but most of the dishes are the most disgusting trash anyone could ask for. Half of the recipes I found were of things that even the most Japanese of friends either can't stand or never eat. Most of the truly appealing fare was barely touched upon at this local shop or that, if it appeared at all. That's a shame. You're also forced to make a batch of truly gross curry and they attempt to bully you into making it again. But not to worry, the cooking element is mostly optional...mostly. It does seem a shame, though, to have such a potentially useful thing end up being so distasteful in so many ways.\n\nThe biggest problem with it being a Musou/Warriors game is that it doesn't play like one, and it isn't fun even for just that. It takes ages to get through sections because the characters won't shut up and keep having cutscenes that you can't skip through, which means you are constantly losing all momentum. You're also expected to try and be stealthy, which is already an element I dislike in most games, but it could randomly decide you're not being stealthy enough and throw you into a fight via cutscene or unexplained gameplay mechanic shenanigans. Add to this the fact that most items you find in a dungeon are literally garbage, and it's very hard to recommend this game to anyone but someone who dearly loves the Persona series and can't get enough of the characters. Even that kind of person might be put off though, because the gameplay is unlike both Persona and Warriors games enough that it is often frustrating for all the wrong reasons. Add to that the fact that the difficulty settings are just a lie, and it's really hard to keep coming back.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "381881da52905ec1ba2b82ba587c1747", "author": "f250a170d935553db4a509b812f2cfbc", "date": "2022-07-14", "hours": 206, "content": "No way, is that a persona reference?!?!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "32cb7d8b3b9b525dacb675029fb4a75a", "author": "30a67189c44150e8afc28fb312a1e594", "date": "2022-07-14", "hours": 28, "content": "Made me realize I was homo", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "28e1f6f3d86f5410ac2e92805c81151e", "author": "ccb40f18a4895fc38641c8f21e93db58", "date": "2022-07-14", "hours": 630, "content": "You will never see it coming", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "01d8ad704ba45a39831eabdd20bd1dc2", "author": "77c3209068cd5dc68eba30ce4da80690", "date": "2022-07-14", "hours": 2678, "content": "See the phantom thieves in action again is enough for me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d62d015be0a954b7ba7643eaa9d5940d", "author": "681b5c3910d95d889af10edeb02bc540", "date": "2022-07-13", "hours": 218, "content": "new gameplay from persona", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c087db21a5a85f658d294ba69d6e00b2", "author": "fd4b6d2ab66a5e46b392bf121f8c1568", "date": "2022-07-13", "hours": 2080, "content": "", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6a5fa6b8ca0d52ec83752bfaafe32d53", "author": "cc68479f45b85c5f8386e093e8681baf", "date": "2022-07-12", "hours": 703, "content": "This game is a 10/10 heavily recommend for players like me\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "653bc70a0df25d95a2a90d7fdb9b1367", "author": "591d94aefdbc5de8badce9c1383d266c", "date": "2022-07-11", "hours": 2261, "content": "recommended, playing persona with hack and slash style", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f5f6fd0a10295b87a8dbd3b888941b0e", "author": "c5aacb5dc4eb514fa5d5beff54b5fcc3", "date": "2022-07-10", "hours": 2863, "content": "Yet another Persona game that makes me crave having friends I can hang out with.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bb3cbe3bae5759a182717a96a9cbf267", "author": "345b7b2a33645d65818b9d55ab68c54c", "date": "2022-07-10", "hours": 187, "content": "", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "47a6a9f45a0854ff8f4c9618412e2e05", "author": "004f2e63d5c5519385bc2aec7cd85797", "date": "2022-07-10", "hours": 2522, "content": "Good Game.\nMissable Achievements: 2 (Just make sure you talk to everyone before moving on to next area)\nDo I need to play the Previous game?

Here is a list of things you might want to know before jumping in: \n\n1)  It is strongly advised to complete original Persona 5 prior to starting this game. Strikers is a direct sequel that draws heavily upon P5, which implies that a) many scenes require familiarity with the story and characters of P5 to fully appreciate, and b) If you have not played Persona 5, Strikers will contain a lot of major spoilers. \n\n2) Beating the Royal version of Persona 5 before Strikers is not required. Apart from a (damn good) battle music track which unlock after completing the main story of Strikers, there are no references to content that Royal adds on top of the original P5. \n\n3) Social links and time management are absent. However, the story contains numerous social scenes, most of which are great. In addition, there will be some optional opportunities to hang out with your friends in certain cities you visit.\n\n4) The story itself is pretty good. Characters are great: new ones receive significant development, while every returning member of Persona 5 cast gets their fair share of moments to shine. \n\n5) Combat happens in real time with time freezing while summoning persona or shooting a gun. However, it features a pretty good implementation of certain key elements from turn-based combat of the original P5: the importance of a diverse persona roster, SP management, buffs and debuffs; weakness system and all-out attacks; various types of technical hits; quirks of different healing spells. Apart from using skills for SP, every persona has its own set of skills which are cast as finishers of various combo moves. To top that off, each teammate has a collection of unique features that personalize their approach to battle. All of this adds up to a very fun, addictive and fluid system, where people with prior knowledge of P5 combat can gain a solid foothold right away. \n\n6) Fusion system is more restrictive, but I still had fun with it. There are much fewer personae in compendium, and each of them has a very limited number of fusion recipes. In addition, some of those recipes require parent persona to be at least of a certain level. However, the game allows you to increase the level of a persona by spending persona points (earned by fusion, releasing personae or collecting personae from battle when your stock is full), so no tedious grinding is necessary to meet those requirements. It's still possible to create really powerful combinations, but now you have to think harder about the way of passing all the skills you want to the target persona. Thankfully, skills cards exist. \n\n7) Dungeons are fun to explore. Apart from distinct visuals, each one has some gameplay or level design features that give it a unique feel. Stealth is the same as it was in P5: simplistic and satisfying. Also, now you can use environmental objects in battle, which is really cool and often powerful.\n\n8) Visuals are stylish as always, and soundtrack is a blast. \n\n9) Completing the main story, all side quests, beating all optional bosses and unlocking New Game + took me approximately 60 hours. Almost no grinding was involved, and I had a lot of fun the entire time (except for a single battle).", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 25, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "75ff7a9003cb56bd8457c1e3856f6f94", "author": "43e7e2a9c0b55242a82d5f60438b6672", "date": "2022-06-29", "hours": 709, "content": "Cool soundtracks and nice story.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fe4b93a2a69a57b19640348a9af684d7", "author": "d31b9761e8825d6c91dc17d754e73c42", "date": "2022-06-28", "hours": 510, "content": "LoOkInG cOOl JoKEr!1!11!!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 22, "funny": 7, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c885f893b1065b8d92c5c53fc99471a3", "author": "deb4312b70bd5fbdb8ddbc2a6821b56f", "date": "2022-06-28", "hours": 568, "content": "I thought I would be like P5 Royal but it was way much better.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0870e9506bc254adb2b2787cf9584c46", "author": "d5fb1f21a4135c9abefa14bde4a7dd24", "date": "2022-06-28", "hours": 221, "content": "Feels more like a Persona game than a Warriors game lmao", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a0ddf3ff560b5e8398f933654ed1e86e", "author": "d78c2240bfe15567be4d6cb63156d506", "date": "2022-06-27", "hours": 4253, "content": "Huge fan of the persona series as a whole and while this game has it's flaws overall this is a really good game and would recommend people this game even if they may not enjoy the dynasty warriors aspects of the game", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "03fc893924545c5987fb58d60cac88a8", "author": "ba80543cd6725eb58333192e8aae8baf", "date": "2022-06-27", "hours": 1419, "content": "10/10 soundtrack and story and gameplay, loved every hour of it!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d5f5e21821655768b44124a866782d42", "author": "4fb7854b71105200a4d2665659bc5e05", "date": "2022-06-26", "hours": 3766, "content": "This game has no business being this cool.

Other than that, my only other complaint is that my Xbox controller is very particular when it comes to this game. You have to wait to connect the controller until the game is running. If you don't, the game will bug out and constantly switch the button icons from Xbox to PS and the button mapping gets funky.\n\nThat aside, this game was a good experience. You'll want to have played P5 or P5R in order to fully grasp the story. The combat was difficult to grasp at first, but after a few hours I got the hang of it, especially after I figured out how to get my controller to work with the game. \n\nWith that being said, I doubt I'll come back to this game after I get all of the achievements for it, or at least not any time soon. It's a great game, and the mainline Persona games are probably my favorite video games of all time, but it doesn't really hold a candle to the mainline games.

I don't know, I'm just wack with my taste, I guess. Still working on The Silver Case too, and I'm almost done with [i] that [/i] game too. Anyways, it's showtime!:\n\n[h1] The Narrative/Story [/h1]\n\nWell...it's a lot like Persona 5's original story (whether it be Vanilla or Royal, doesn't matter cause they both segway into Strikers.) This time around, you've travelling all around Japan and saving the world once again! Everyone gets their own moments to shine in the story again, which is nice and we do see the development from P5 show up here. It's hard to really comment on as it really just boils down to the Phantom Thieves (along with a couple of members, one of which is unironically one of the best parts about the game.) \n\nThe locations chosen work with the story and the pacing and writing were fine, better than Vanilla 5's writing in my opinion. I think the themes that felt a little tacked on in the original are either written better here or the new themes (like family issues in Haru's case, not going into any spoilers) are decently enough written. The entire of the game....mehhh...it's kinda cheesy, maybe I'm just used to the Persona formula of having happy but sad endings, but it still had me invested through the end.\n\nI'll give it either a A-/B+, it's alright. Not the best writing in the world, but far from the worst...trust me...I'm...not so fond of some of P3's writing in particular, but we'll save that for when Persona 3 Portable gets ported to PC sometime next year...\n\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nProbably the best aspect about this game. Being a Muso game (and having played Hyrule Warriors on Wii U a long time ago), I actually really enjoyed this game's gameplay. Sure, after a while, it gets a bit repetitive, but upgrading you and your party members as well as mastering new skills by just doing combos and whatnot freshens the game up a bit, not to mention you're [i] always [/i] getting new Personas and strengthening them, getting them new skills just like in normal P5. A lot of the mechanics carried over quite well to this game and in my opinion, this is one of the best Muso games I've played (which isn't saying much because again, I've only played Hyrule Warriors before this game that was back when the game came out.)\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that if you like doing side content, getting some of the [i] really [/i] good demons and having the best equipment possible for everyone like me, you'll have to do quite a bit of grinding for money and Persona Points (PP for short...kind of an really overused term in RPGs if you ask me.) I'd say it's mostly worth it get to awesome Personas like Yoshitsune, Alice, and Mara and with the ability to pitch which skills to inherit when fusing, skill-swapping for Joker's Personas any time in overworld in the Persona menu, and a constant flow of new Personas, grinding shouldn't be too bad, I'd say money's the biggest issue and even then there's ways around it. So I guess the only complaint I have with it asides from it potential repetitiveness is that it's a little grindy, especially towards the end.\n\nA-, it's pretty solid stuff and I'm genuinely surprised how the mechanics from Persona/SMT carried over into a Hack N' Slash as well as they did here.\n\n[h1] The Visual/Audio Design [/h1]\n\n[i] *Sigh* [/i] Yeah... this is one of the weaker parts of this game. Let me get the graphics out of the way first, though.\n\nVisually, the game looks great! The overworlds are nice and detailed and look great without suffering any performance issues (which surprises me quite a bit given that I've heard Muso games usually have pretty bad PC ports or at least mediocre ones that have their issues) and the effects like the ones seen on the Personas is nice. The menu, while not [i] as [/i] stylish as P5's original menus are still pretty nice here and definitely have their own flair and are relatively easy to navigate (minus the menu before the final boss which was...kind of clunky.) I really can't complain about anything visually with the game, the models are all nice, the FMVs both pre-rendered and animated are quite nice and the game looks pretty good for game that was on Switch and PS4 originally (the former suffering pretty badly from framerate issues from what I've heard.) Point is, it looks good, Atlus did great with this game's visually just as I'd expect them to.\n\nNow the audio....uhhh...well...it's not great. Let's start with the voice-acting. I kinda feel like a few of the cast members forgot how to do their original character's voices, Ryuji sounded kinda off here and there especially and so did Joker, and some of the other character's actual audio sounds quieter or louder than others which is also kind of distracting. You can definitely tell this game was recorded during COVID while the everyone was at home, but they certainly tried and to be fair, the further along the game goes everyone sounded just fine again, so I guess it was just a few lines from everyone that got a little messed up. The acting for the new characters were perfect! Loved Zenkichi's VA's performance especially, he absolutely nailed the character and really made the banter between the Thieves lively. Sophia's...fine too, I can't really say anything about her without going into spoilers, but she did fine with her roll too. A- stuff, if only because of the few lines that could've been re-recorded to sound better and...not forcing people to record from home and just have them socially distance and record in a studio, it is what is, though.\n\nAs for the music...well...I was told not to use the default music and to just use the Persona BGM DLC I'd bought with my Deluxe Edition I got about a year ago (...yeah, this game's been on my backlog for A WHILE now...and the other DLC is kinda whatever, I used it for the beginning of the game and never used it again, so it kinda felt like a waste, I forgot to mention that in gameplay, but whatever) and while I enjoyed the DLC music being there for Persona 1-4, the other music was okay too, nothing special and it got a little repetitive hearing the same few battle songs over and over again, but there's some original music in here (namely Daredevil) which are absolutely [i] banging [/i] tunes. I'd say the overall OST excluding the DLC music is a B+, it's alright, there's some good songs in there, but [i] a lot [/i] of the music was reused from OG P5, which is a little...I guess lame.\n\n[h1] The Verdict/Conclusion [/h1]\n\nWhile this game does have its issues of being a little grindy and being a little repetitive, it's a nice companion piece to P5 that I'm sure anyone would played the original game (and also likes Muso games and or Hack N' Slashes) will enjoy. I'd give it around a 7.5-8.0/10, nothing spectacular, but a solid game that kept me invested til the end. If you've got like 70 hours to spare like I did (I idled for some of my hours to get to 93.1, don't always believe my hours, Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 were also botched in that regard), then go for it.\n\nOh, but here's one piece of advice [b] PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE. WAIT FOR A SALE. [/b] Yes, I know this game's only a year old, but that doesn't excuse it for being overpriced (especially with the DLC like...really? $10 for a BGM pack, jeez man. Meanwhile, Atlus is STILL pulling this kind of stuff with Nocturne HD Remaster and more atrociously and recently with Soul Hackers 2...which I'm not gonna even bother buying until it goes on sale because 1. I still wanna play the original and 2. I don't want pay $100+ for a new game, that's just ridiculous.), it's a good game, but not $60 good, $30 maybe at most.\n\nWell, if you're still up for it despite that, then it's showtime!\n\n\n[h1] Post-Review Ramble [/h1]\n\nSo uhhh...yeah.

A subtle hint I like about this game is the lack of confidants/social links, with the new BOND system taking its place. It says all the individual bonds between Joker and the rest of the regularly scheduled Phantom Thieves are as \u2018maxed\u2019 as much as possible, being more about enjoying the experiences of their trip around Japan and becoming a tighter group overall as opposed to the compartmentalized substories SLs tend to be. \n\nZenkichi and Sophia are also great additions with great character arcs, the former reminding me of previous Hierophant Arcana characters and their respective daughters, but this one being something the Phantom Thieves have an active, prolonged hand in that makes it feel very believable and relatable. Sohpia is a bit more predictable of an AI gaining sentience, but she still has a very heartwarming personality and conclusion. They both remind me quite a bit of Takuto Maruki, may Billy Kametz rest in piece. \n\nAs someone who has never played a Dynasty Warriors game, I have to say the combination of action and turn based combat from both series is put together seamlessly and the moment to moment gameplay flows perfectly. Baton passing and showtimes really make you feel like working as a team has true benefits and each interaction really brings each PT\u2019s character out, my favorite showtime being Zenkichi\u2019s. \n\nSo yeah, P5S is a great addition to the Persona series, even if a full $60 is a bit steep coming off 120+ hours from Royal. I\u2019d conclude it calling it a very heartwarming experience, that\u2019s the feeling I got from my time with it if I had to describe it in one word. Great straightforward story that lets us see our favorite delinquents again and seamless gameplay that is punchy, cathartic and as stylish and over-the-top as ever.

I originally played about 40 hours.  I wanted to like it...........I really did. However, there are some very \"meh\" aspects. First of which is the predictability in the flow of the game. Travel to new place, eat, find a new jail and liberate people, travel again......wash rinse and repeat. I suppose those things would be fine if they weren't each so shallow.  Each new area/place requires an investigation phase. This would simply mean talking to a few npcs..........and boom! Investigation is complete. The eating phase is simply the characters raving for about 2-3 minutes about what foods to eat in the area. This means nothing to you, the player, or to the story. It's done by cut-scenes. Ultimately it feels like a lot of the dialogue during this phase is just rehashed over and over. One character is excited about a certain food, and other characters mention alternatives.  The next issue is...............\n\nThe predictability of the issues surrounding the monarchs. Several of the monarchs have ties to members of your party, but it's not done in an interesting way. What's more, it follows the unfortunate pattern in anime-like games where it feels like every character has to say their \"piece\" regarding to a situation, and it's really not necessary........especially when they are just agreeing with each other in different words. \n\nThe gameplay is simplistic and while it may seem really cool about creating and improving new personas..........you will eventually start to lose enthusiasm despite multiple new personas being available at each level. Why? Because you will notice that the move-sets are the same as other personas and that the stats really don't vary that much when within 10 levels of each other. \n\nThe leveling is broken when you can earn as much experiance and more money in the beginning area of the 2nd jail than you can by the time you  can enter the 5th jail. The beginning area of the 2nd jail is one of the few areas where enemies respawn (including a near-500 exp enemy). Just continue to let yourself get detected and maintain it around the 30%-90% and go after the crystal enemy each time you hear it on the map.  The crystal enemy also gives about 500 exp.

This allows Persona fans to enjoy the story continuing from its original ending, but also allow for new players, experiencing the Persona series for the first time, to enjoy the game. The story isn't anything too great but is good enough for an enjoyable experience. The story is very linear, meaning the choices made by your character will have no impact towards the endings. The dialogue options only affects how the other characters will respond and could make for some funny interactions between characters. The character interactions are great and provides lots of humorous and some badass moments.\n\nThe gameplay is where it truly deviates from the usual Persona Series. All previous installations of the Persona franchise (Not including spinoffs like Arena or the Dancing games) were mainly Turn-Based JRPG, but P5S is a Hack and Slash. \nThis makes the game more fast-paced and action packed but could be a turn off for those who enjoy the strategy of Persona games. \n\nP5S is also significantly shorter as compared to the other Persona games. It took me 40+ hrs to clear the base game and could easily be cleared in a shorter amount of time as I took the time to do every requests and search every nook and cranny of each jail. Also there is still New Game+ to play which could easily take me an additional 20hrs or so. Making the total game time to be around 50-60hrs.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a solid 7/10. Gameplay is good but certain parts felt repetitive (especially farming Persona Points to fuse certain Personas in the later part of the game). Story was pretty so-so but the character interactions were great. I would recommend buying this game on a sale for anyone who enjoys Hack-and-Slash or are Persona Fans.\n\nEDIT: Took me an additional 25hrs to complete all achievements. Have yet to complete NG+ playthrough, but doubt I would finish it. It is still a fun game to me but to 100% it did not feel as fun as just completing the game on the first run. It lacked the replayability that all base Persona games have but the challenge that Merciless posed in the early stages of NG+ was indeed quite challenging. However, once you fused a few max stats Personas, the game becomes quite a breeze and just knowing how to use Status Ailments and Technical to your advantage to wipe through most bosses relatively easily. This does not change my rating of it as to 100% a game is more of a perfectionist or if the game is really one of your favorites.

I finished Persona 5 (2 times), Persona 4, I've played Dancing in the past, and I'm currently playing Q and 3.\n\nI CANNOT recommend this game. I am not a fan of Dynasty Warrior themed games. However, the problem goes beyond that. I didn't feel any... heart and soul in this spinoff. It just feels empty. I love the cities, they're beautifully designed and animated but... The dialogue isn't getting with me. It feels like dialogue that was created by an AI just for the sake of rushing out a half-baked story. The heroes don't feel like they're emotionally tied to the villains like they were in Persona 5, and beyond that? The villains just simply aren't interesting to begin with. It feels like they were just thrown into the mix for the sake of combat instead of them having a place in the story.\n\nThe perfect description for this game is generic. It's just not good, in my opinion. I found myself skipping through dialogue, and even skipping cutscenes. Cutscenes! I've never skipped anything in a Persona game prior to this game! A single sentence can easily sum up what was drug out through pages upon pages of generic, filler-like dialogue. And speaking of being drug out, I feel like this whole game is drug out through and through. As I got closer to the end of the game, I found myself wanting more and more for it to be over, groaning as I discovered 2 extra jails past what I believed to be the final boss.\n\nI will say this - this is the most advanced Dynasty Warrior themed game out there. And with that being said... It still manages to be a boring, repetitive slog in terms of gameplay. The combat is just X, with a few Y's thrown into the mix for a petty amount of combos you can do. The combat, in reality, just becomes spamming whatever ~Ma move hits everybody's weakness.\n\nToday, I'm gonna FORCE myself to finish this game, just for the sake of uninstalling it to free up space on my computer. Yeah, you heard that right, force. You should NEVER have to force yourself to finish a game, it means it just straight up isn't a fun/good game. It just feels like such a slog... As a person who literally completed New Game and New Game + of P5R back to back with no break, I'm heavily disappointed with this spinoff - and if I could... honestly? I'd refund it. I hope the next spinoff will be better.\n\nEdit: I was so bored playing this that ultimately \"forcing myself to play it today\" turned into forcing myself to play it spread out through a period of a few days.

Very Good\nSoundtrack? It's a banger \ud83e\udd18\nArtstyle / Graphics? Beautiful\nStory? Good\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA sequel to Persona 5 - The gameplay changes from the usual turn based combat that you can find in all Persona games to a hack-and-slash type combat you can find in games such as in the Dynasty Warrior series. While it does change the gameplay, the gameplay is very good, especially in Persona 5's artstyle. Gameplay is very good.\n\nSoundtrack can be described with one word: Amazing. The songs you'll usually hear in this game are remixes of songs you'll find in the original Persona 5, but do not get me wrong, THEY ARE NOT BAD! The remixes are just as good as the original songs they are remixed from. You'll enjoy the battle themes, boss themes, etc. The original songs made for this game though are good, while continuing to retain the Persona 5 OST's original style.\n\nThe artstyle is still the same as it was from Persona 5, and it looks gorgeous. As I said from earlier, the combat looks SO fantastic due to Persona 5's artstyle, making everything look flashy and just all around beautiful. Though, I can say it may be overwhelming for a small amount of people, but it wasn't for me.\n\nThe story isn't necessarily the best or what you expect from a Persona game, but it is a good sequel to Persona 5 story-wise. The story does take place a few months after the end of the original Persona 5, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion. For those who hasn't played Persona 5 originally, I wouldn't really recommend playing this game at first, as there may be things you don't understand, or things you would appreciate more if you played through the original Persona 5, such as the characters. That's to say though, the developers for this game did say you can enjoy the game even if you didn't play the original Persona 5, so knock yourself out. Overall though, story's great.\n\nThanks for reading.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e34eaa5d70f85363bf87bb96930e2db8", "author": "c2a4a79d192f5b78a3f2f8d55c1d1c8f", "date": "2022-04-08", "hours": 2264, "content": "Some of the story beats can drag on, especially when they follow Persona 5's footsteps closely, but this game is still just as stylish and jazzy as its predecessor.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e680971bc7d5539092337365e60af715", "author": "9253f3c155c55461a063e32ab1c3c5f9", "date": "2022-04-06", "hours": 549, "content": "\"The Phantom Thieves stole my heart once again!\" \ud83e\udd13", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e181ad8234075b5e934fd33aa6c6bd41", "author": "ea7b31a78dc45c9399793d65fa2a493e", "date": "2022-04-06", "hours": 2628, "content": "I hate Dynasty Warriors\n\nI like this game.... a lot.\n\nThat should say something.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "421f566cd7b45abbaa7ce7c92737abc7", "author": "d61e0c72ce0c5128a71514ca6a0982fc", "date": "2022-04-06", "hours": 408, "content": "yes this game is really good but please GIVE US PERSONA 5 ROYAL ON STEAM", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b67870dfa58b553db8a390663a02c4eb", "author": "012225b04f3455bfbcb97f8fc76abca1", "date": "2022-04-05", "hours": 125, "content": "This game is good, absolutely.

Now about Strikers, it takes all of that and simplifies some aspects but makes others lots of fun. Strikers still has an amazing and compelling story just like Persona 5 and 4... is it predictable, a little bit, BUT I think that is okay as the story is really just there to have a base for the AMAZING game play that Strikers has.

This is sequel to the original, faithful in every way EXCEPT that it has a completely different mode of gameplay. It resembles Musou's, if you've played Dynasty Warriors OR Hyrule Warriors, you should know pretty quickly what you're getting into. I'm not a Fighting game man but you're gonna have to remember some button inputs.\n\nShould edit this as I go on. Initial impressions are good, except what in the hell are these keyboard bindings. The main character and Makoto are the only ones without free aiming, just why!?! If you're gonna play this with keyboard and mouse, I think an extra button or two on your mouse will help you out. if you have good reflexes, get the Level 1 Avenger skill (Not available initially), with which you can nullify an attack if you Phanton Dash towards that enemy at the perfect time; I tell you this as it brought me the most joy out of the combat in the game.\n\nI suffer slowdowns after a few battles, and had to reset the game. Later I found out it's caused by the Rendering Scale option. You also have to tab out of the game and come back for the slowdowns to go off or for the Rendering Scale option to apply. I change back to 1.3 Scale if I know there won't be battles for a while so it doesn't look so jagged (You cannot change this option in the middle of battle so don't plan to do it in the middle of the dungeon's boss fight before an hour of unpausable story!)\n\nAtlus, if you're not going to port the original Persona 5 OR Royal (The extended version) just yet, at the very least make your other releases up to par (Tip: Don't look up anything about the game if you wanna avoid spoilers, seriously, Youtube reviews should suffice, avoid comments or even Community Hub content).\n\nYou might want this mod, the letterbox border is just terrible, it looks like a bug: https://gamebanana.com/mods/288445", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 11, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5a797bc13561566db3cdf1bddc8870b3", "author": "325db4a431145debb771d58f65139ea8", "date": "2022-03-20", "hours": 248, "content": "", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "22c10869f03a54c28066c9b0c31f869b", "author": "a6b3ea87dd685a1cbee98638d6420df9", "date": "2022-03-20", "hours": 3611, "content": "Great follow up story to the already outstanding story telling from Persona 5 & Persona 5 Royal.

So around March of 2020, both on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4.

If you think you gonna see characters from Royal in this game, I'm sorry to say but they aren't in it. The story in this game is somewhat alright, I do like in some aspects and some I don't but I won't mention anything due to spoilers and I don't want to spoil anything. The gameplay is pretty alright kinda just stiffy imo, but once you get used to it, you can play it. One thing I would like to complain about is the fusion system, it's feels off like extremely but I think it's just me.

the first palace in this game is a girl that takes advantage of men, the second dungeon is a guy who sells writing that isn't actually his... the third dungeon is a cross of okumura and a crappy shido, the fourth is the only actual interesting dungeon that i won't spoil anything for, the fifth has nothing to mention, but the sixth dungeon's antagonist is just a copy and paste of shido and the next one after that is basically mementos and ending the world all over again. nothing in this game is original whatsoever. one of the characters, sophia, is a copy and paste of aigis from persona 3. the only character in this game that i actually liked was the final antagonist, ichinose kuon, had a good personality and ok motive, which is the only reason i liked her, but it was literally just akechi 2.0 and you also could easily tell she would be the antagonist immediately after speaking to her from the first time. the way she was revealed as the antagonist isn't good either. in royal or golden for example you are interacting with the antagonist the whole time and tension is built and you later realize they've been betraying you the whole time, in this game, it's just \"oh, remember kuon from way back when? yeah shes behind this\" it's so unbelievably stupid. also, the final enemy of the game is, \"phones took over everyones lives and we can't think for ourselves now\" literally the dumbest story ever\n\nthe design/look of the game is the only thing i can credit the game on, outside of the dungeons, the game looks absolutely great, despite being terrible in the dungeons. not much to say here\n\nthe music was another strong point. in the persona games. the persona games are the only games i know where the music in them can be good enough to put in playlists with \"real music\", in this game, all of the original songs made specifically for this game are absolute bangers. the only complaint is that any song that received a \"remix\" for scramble that was taken from 5 absolutely sucks in this, because they tried to turn a jazzy thing into rock, and it absolutely sucks.\n\nthe only reason i forced myself to play through this is because i've beaten every persona game and i had to force myself to play this to say i'm fully up with the story in every game and i also spent 70 dollars on it sooooooo\n\nyea don't buy this game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 6, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f809a1f00f1b5dddb8a3cbad7aacd027", "author": "6c9c4e6d77f0585da77ae8b756a427d9", "date": "2022-03-15", "hours": 1778, "content": "This is an easy recommendation for me. The story can sometimes drag and feel like it's progressing nowhere. At times, the gameplay can feel a little clunky and disjointed. However, ultimately I think these more minor issues can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the game. It was nice to see these characters brought back for another (much shorter) story. \nGetting past these moments where the story can drag is relatively easy, but the gameplay is harder to write off. In my eyes, the original Persona 5 practically perfected JRPG combat, but the Action RPG gameplay on display here is just serviceable. I eventually got used to pausing the action to use persona abilities, but I feel like getting used to this overall hindered my experience with the game. I didn't really have a problem with it, but it's worth noting that this game lacks a confidant system entirely, and the days progress as the story progresses.\nWhile maybe not being quite as good as the original game\u2019s, the soundtrack is very well done. All of the new tracks were really memorable, and remixes of old tracks were too. The opening was great as well.\nThe story starts strong, drags on for a little while, then picks right back up as it climaxes.

P5S is pretty good, a little lacking in story and villain development with sometimes clunky controls.\n\nThis game is basically Atlus's experiment at doing an ARPG, it turned out 'okay'. Camera and lock targeting is pretty lack luster. You have to 'pause' a lot with persona/gun to just get an understanding of what is going on and switching between characters is a little clunky for an modern ARPG. On top of that, the battles are 'instanced' so you lose a little of the open-world-esque that you would expect from an ARPG.\n\nThough you have a calendar like past Personas, the game is a little more free form with the player choices.

He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\n\nStrategy\n\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\n\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\n\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\n\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\n\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\n\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\n\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\n\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\n\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\n\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\n\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\n\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\n\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\n\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\n\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\n\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider\u2019s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\n\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\n\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\n\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "383e925a88235db5a32b3b9ea1b97819", "author": "410f2c33820a5adda97d9305049087a8", "date": "2022-03-08", "hours": 910, "content": "Great game overall.

While this game's menu animations aren't quite as immaculate as the original game's, they did a fantastic job carrying over the look of Persona 5 into this engine, to the point where a lot of the time it literally just looks like more of P5, but now running in 60fps. Per Persona tradition, the OST is still absolutely amazing, even in what is essentially a spin-off, and with that classic Warriors-style buttrock flavor appropriately mixed in as well.\n\nThe combat is very interesting at first. While attack combos and switching between characters feels a lot like other recent Warriors games, it still has a LOT of mechanics from P5. Sneaking up on enemies, going in and out of battle encounters, Persona skills, elemental weaknesses, all-out attacks, managing your HP and SP with items, even a lite Confidant system is here. However, much like Warriors games, you are often fighting a LOT of enemies at once, and nothing seems to stop all of them from attacking you at once, with all sorts of different abilities. This makes the combat VERY overwhelming for me, to the point where I definitely prefer Persona games' usual turn-based combat.\n\nAs someone who wasn't particularly impressed by the story and characters in Persona 5, it's kind of hard to get into this game for those same aspects, especially since a lot of it feels like a retread of the original game's plot points anyway. I almost dropped this game entirely since the story is pretty samey in the first few dungeons. Still, if you really like the cast of Persona 5, then you might have a great time with this game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "723d202b5a22596ab0075e1cb7ede9b8", "author": "35a9ebf8f2d05d0a9e42946ed132cbf4", "date": "2022-02-27", "hours": 7572, "content": "the game, is fun.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9029d2f10afc5b0d8b8c1c622779e7e1", "author": "7f8f44415a2852d19738b772a4f93735", "date": "2022-02-26", "hours": 2733, "content": "The perfect sequel, personally liked the combat and exploration more than og p5 and p5r.

When you do an All-out attack or the screen says \"Shows over\" it's supposed to signify telling the enemy \"smell ya later\" in a flashy end to the fight. But here it takes maybe a centimeter off some midboss' interminable health bar? The best thing this game's combat does is make you appreciate how well designed the original P5's combat is. Not many people look or feel good frantically button-mashing into a huge dude. It's just awful; it's awkward, it's long, it's painful, it tests reflexes that you didn't need in P5, and you have to do way more of it than you did before because this is a much more fighty game.\n\nCan't speak for later antagonists, but at least the first one is a complete writeoff. One of the things Persona games do brilliantly is encode a larger theme into the motivation for each foe. P5 is centered around rebellion, so that every boss feels almost cathartic to beat. P5S has, at least so far, just been \"let's beat this person up because they're bad and we're good\". There's no theme to this, and it makes the story feel way less fulfilling. The only thing I'm still here for is more of the main cast, and even then there are no bonding events so the interaction is superficial at best.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 3, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3918cf3a53da52ee8a501b722aeb0e33", "author": "73b17781bbe1522c88eee5e50522b119", "date": "2022-02-01", "hours": 227, "content": "I loved playing this on the PS4, PS5 and Switch, I had to pick it up on Steam when it went on sale. \n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, and the story is a great follow-up to the Persona 5 game.

It functions as both a spin-off of a spin-off and a direct sequel to Persona 5. Therefore, I would highly recommend playing Persona 5 before diving into Strikers. Also, be sure to bring your PS4 controller for this one, as I felt the frantic combat feels significantly better on a controller.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it amazes me how well the flair and strategy of Persona combat mixes with the frantic, visually-busy Musou combat. The only other Musou game I've played is Hyrule warriors, yet I enjoyed the combat in this game much more. In fact,  it feels more like the combat in FFVII Remake. Button-mashing won't get you far; I had to turn down the difficulty to Easy until I was acclimated with the combat mechanics. Each character and Persona has their own combos, elemental affinities, and spells. Nothing makes me feel more like a badass than mowing down an army of Shadows with the power of friendship and the manifestations of your inner rebel. \n\nMoving on to the story, it parallels much of the narrative drawn in the original Persona 5. Without going into details, I will say that the first couple Jails serve to introduce you to the mechanics and lore of Jails. The monarchs of said jails are just one-and-done antagonists whose hearts you change. After this, the way the story ramps up parallels Persona 5 rather closely. It should be noted that the story is shorter (with regards to Persona standards). However, this is not an issue and I felt the pacing was actually well-done.\n\nMusic in the Persona series is nothing short of exceptional, and Strikers is no different. I did not think it was possible that \"Rivers in the Desert\" or \"Blooming Villain\" could be made any more epic than they already are. Later, you can even customize which songs play during battle.\n\nThe voice acting is stellar, including those of the new characters. Sophia is such sweetheart; her character growth is well written. As for Zenkichi, his character arc draws parallels to Dojima from P4. He and Sophia fit right into the Persona universe, unlike Lana in Hyrule Warriors, who seemed out-of-place.\n\nWith the amount of action going on, the game never dipped in framerate or crashed. One of my favorite changes involves NG+. You get all the characters and equipment from your first playthrough, unlike in P5 where you were limited to certain characters because of the story. It allows for ample time to customize and deck out all the Phantom Thieves with the best gear and moves. \n\nOverall, there is not much I disliked about the game. The damage sponginess of some of the bosses on the harder difficulties is a bit exasperating (and don't get me started on Merciless...). Nevertheless,  this is definitely worth a purchase if you liked Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bbc66dc4b0805b5d80022c644bed8cb1", "author": "197652acd2a45f38805f3a00301aa003", "date": "2022-01-31", "hours": 3066, "content": "I'm not exactly the most professional person to give my opinion obviously, and especially not someone who's played a ton of Persona outside 5 and it's spin-offs. But I'd say that this was an extremely fun experience. The story isn't all that complex or thought provoking and can be a tad generic, or even rehashed from the original at times. But every area has a good message and consistently interesting dialogue between the party members. Like the original, the cast is great. And the two new additions to the crew are very much welcome. Then combat, much like the story, is pretty simple. Many of the mechanics are the same as far as weaknesses, and how buffs affect you and the enemy go. However this time it's put in an entirely different system. Ditching the turn based combat of the Persona series and making it a stylized and unique version of the Dynasty Warriors format. And with that in mind I can concede that it isn't for everyone. But in my personal opinion, the combat is fun, fast paced, and certain battles can genuinely feel grand. Notably the various boss fights. All the animations are very good and stay true to the style. Each character has their own personal tech and that gives them even more diversity than just simply different elements and basic attacks. All the showtime attacks look great as expected, and all out attacks are just as satisfying. I don't even NEED to get started on the music. Every track is just so amazing, and best of all you never have to hear the same track over and over since every battle is randomized. All the remixes are fantastic, and a personal favourite of mine is counterstrike. But on that note, I'll complete this miniature review. I'm yet to play New Game Plus, as I am writing this almost immediately after completing the main story. But I can only assume it'll add some bonus content that add a little more spice into a second playthrough.

The style is much more hack-and-slash and doesn't allow for nearly as much sneakery, but I still like it. I think it's easier than the og game, so if you want a challenge, you'll probably need to turn up the difficulty later on. The story is good, but could have benefited from a little more work. The game keeps crashing for me, and it got more frequent after I updated my computer, but I'm only passable with computers, so I don't know what to attribute that to. It could just be my computer, honestly.\n\nOkay, so I really love the game, because I missed Persona 5 and wanted to play it again but I don't own it (I stayed with my cousin and played it while I was there) but recently, it's been crashing about every hour or so so I updated my computer to see if that would help, and it just made the crashes more frequent. Unfortunately, I'm no computer geek, so I have no idea what's going on or why and no way to figure it out because I'm scared of messing stuff up even more and also because I wouldn't know what I'm looking at. I can't tell if this is an issue with my computer, which is a zephyr gaming computer, I think, so it's fairly beefy compared to my old dell, or if it's an issue with the game. The game itself is very good if you're just looking for more Persona 5 content, but this game isn't in the same, turn-based style of gameplay, so be warned. It's a more of a battle royale with fewer options for sneaking around in the shadows. Personally, I've found it much easier than the original game and have turned it up to the hard difficulty, but I enjoy it nevertheless. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've found the story to be quite interesting. Not nearly as complex and planned out as the original game, mind you, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. I've been playing the game infrequently, so pardon my lapses in memory. The cooking mechanic is interesting, but they don't offer too many sp items for just one party member. There are several for full party, but the coffee beans needed to make Leblanc's coffee are offered very infrequently. I also feel like the areas you stay at get a little boring after a while, because it does take a good amount of time to beat a Jail (which is the Palace substitute. Jails are more for people with trauma who didn't deal with it in healthy ways and didn't get help, I think). Overall, I think it's a pretty good game with an interesting addition to the view of the Persona 5 Metaverse. It could use some work, but perfection isn't real or a healthy expectation to have. It's best enjoyed if you're just looking for something new to play once you've finished with Persona 5 and want a new story in the same universe. It does keep crashing, but I don't know if that's my computer or the game so I can't really comment on that.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8459148df1f55d908d76317fc22b1f8b", "author": "6a87b37675195fcd9c27e56905910980", "date": "2022-01-17", "hours": 1908, "content": "Very good Very nice easy to play and get lost in", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74e6846a4e125ac3985669de36db8455", "author": "4f6e2cccfcda55bbaa2075506ca66dbb", "date": "2022-01-17", "hours": 3597, "content": "Loses points for zero mention of Akechi but im obsessed with the new characters LOL Zenkichi pls call me back", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 11, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8808d4d2df3e5a2baf550da97fbe71c5", "author": "184661b380945f96847e080cf99489c4", "date": "2022-01-16", "hours": 2242, "content": "First off, you will have to have beaten Persona 5 do its ending to understand this game.

It is the first truly great Dynasty-Warriors type spinoff I've ever played. All the others have ranged from bad-mediocre. But this game stands on the shoulders of Persona 5 and has a fantastic combat system, story, music, and characters. Only complaints are that the plot takes a little while to get on its feet, some predictability in the plot, the lack of exp for members not in your party leaving them underleveled whenever you want to change your party setup, and the relative simplicity of the individual characters' movesets when compared to other games of this type.

But I can still say with certainty that the flair, writing, and characters feel straight out of the main game. While this may be labeled as a \"Spinoff\", it is just as much a true sequel to the original Persona 5. (Not Royal.)\n\nDespite being seen as a \"Warriors\" spinoff of sorts like other series received (Such as Hyrule Warriors or Fire Emblem Warriors), Strikers keeps many of the aspects that make the Warriors games have their flair and charm, while also keeping many story and gameplay aspects that make it feel like a true Persona game as well. The use of skills, weakness exploitation, and even Joker's Wild Card ability are all present, and translated faithfully in the newer hack-and-slash gameplay style. While at the same time still feeling like a dedicated RPG. I'm honestly impressed how well they kept the feel of Persona in the gameplay, not making it feel too alienated as a sequel to P5. (Unlike with my experience with games like Hyrule Warriors, which feels like a Warriors game, but with Zelda characters slapped onto it.) Even so; the gameplay is still very different from regular Persona. It just is faithful in carrying over a lot of signature aspects of the series.\n\nAnd as for the story; I really enjoyed it as well. I won't go into many details, but I can still say for certain that it feels like a natural progression from the ending of Persona 5.\nThe characters all feel the same, they all keep their original voices, and some characters who may have been lacking in P5 got more development and purpose in Strikers. (Primarily with Haru.)\nEven though there are no longer any social aspects in Strikers, the writing and character interactions still feel like what you'd see in regular Persona, albeit a bit more linear. Which honestly; I don't have a problem with.\nI also really enjoyed the new characters added to the game, especially Zenkichi.\n\nAll-in-all, P5 Strikers is a fantastic game, especially if you're a fan of P5 already.\nMy only gripe is that due to being a sequel to P5, you kinda need to see the story of the base game's True Ending to understand a lot of points covered in the story of Strikers. But at the same time; if your there just for the gameplay and not so much the story (Or you just don't mind spoilers), then the game itself has its own content and story to look forward to. Even if you may not pick up on all the references made to the previous game.\n\nEven still; I highly recommend this game.

Instead of creating dairy products that becomes expired even before they are shipped, they ensure that all of their cows are in good health alongside carrying out daily inspections and QC procedures on their machines before doing anything. Almost every single one of their spin offs are made with love and care. \n\nThat includes Persona 5 Strikers. The turn-based + musou hybrid is what I would like to see in future musou games. Although the combos provided for each character are less varied, it does not overstay its welcome as they are also numerous persona skills that we can use to defeat a horde of enemies. On top of that, by utilizing the baton pass from P5, we can control 4 different characters in a single map. Something that most musou titles lack. In addition, the game includes two new playable characters. An AI girl named Sophia and another one which I am not going to mention the name to avoid spoiler territory. Trust me, they fit so well in the phantom thieves gang and each of them will receive their own spotlights they deserve. \n\nAN IMPORTANT NOTE: \n\nDo not play this game, if you have not yet play the mainline game or at least watch a walkthrough on youtube. Bits of the plot from P5 will be mentioned a few times so proceed with caution. \n\nIf you love persona 5, then you will surely going to like strikers as well, Don't let the musou tag turn you off, the combat feels natural and not overly repetitive like the traditional musou games. Of course, it depends on peoples' preferences at the end of the day. As expected from Atlus, their remarkable assortment of musical pieces are unique, memorable and well-composed as always. For those who want a fairly lengthy JRPG, then persona 5 strikers is perfect for you too judging by the total amount of hours I spent to complete all 50 side quests which will appear as an achievement if you manage to unlock it + beating the main story. \n\n*CUTE AI GIRL GO BRRR*\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c99f68a217355dbd8ef679a31426cd4f", "author": "90975597cd165d8b8d2fadc3ce4e377e", "date": "2021-12-20", "hours": 3181, "content": "very nice and fun game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "201fdc114cb353e8a82bc584702b9880", "author": "344f1b7084da549db6f9f79324e5e7cf", "date": "2021-12-20", "hours": 2247, "content": "Best sequel to any game, magnificent masterpiece with banger soundtrack that you would come back to the only thing people would dislike is the skill level but a long time Persona fan would be comfortable beating it.\n\nReview from the guy could 100% game with all personas", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7892c2e7eb22577483173c8799ed0995", "author": "e1ea8105aab75060824c33e62704d0f7", "date": "2021-12-19", "hours": 2506, "content": "A successful sequel for an amazing RPG!

But with so many characters to play as (8 other than Joker) I barely found any use in directly controlling Joker. Why use a fire based Persona when Ann can already use fire spells and use her fire whip moves that cost no SP? And same with each other Phantom Thief with their respective elemental spells. It made sense in a turn-based RPG like the original  P5, but here you can just hack/slash/spell cast to your hearts content.\n\nAll in all a fun, mindless game that honestly needs tweaking in the combat department, but I'd still recommend this to fans of P5 for the story, and to see these beloved characters return in a new setting.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c5321cac42bb575abf8c075a8a1d0d27", "author": "3d42d925a0c15542909ee33cb6659312", "date": "2021-12-18", "hours": 287, "content": "Unresolved technical issue.

Boss fights can drag on and fights with random enemies are either frustrating or too easy. It seems like I spend most of my time spamming shoot rather than pulling off combos and using magic because enemies do too much damage. SP is much better spent using healing spells rather than elemental or buff / debuff spells because damage is so high. You can use other characters, but why would you when Joker is the best one to be using. Maybe it's because is just came off playing the One Piece Pirate Warriors series but the lack of variety during combat drags this game down. Usually your combo is 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,1,1,1,2,2 (1 being a light attack and 2 being a heavy attack), because those combos use your equipped persona's element (which means you don't have to spend precious SP on offensive magic to hit weaknesses). \n\nThe Velvet Room and persona fusion are cut down and almost a waste of time in this game. You cannot just fuse any two personas anymore. There are set combinations you can use. This is sad because this is what originally drew me to the Persona series in the first place. \n\nHowever, combat and the Velvet Room are the only bad things about this game. Just like Persona 5, the UI and design elements to this game are fantastic. Seeing your equipped persona in the bottom left of the screen always looks cool because there is a unique portrait there for every persona. Menu transitions don't get in the way too much and are worth the time they use. \n\nThe main characters are just as I knew them in Persona 5 (with the disappointing lack of Dr. Maruki and Sumi from the Royal version of the game). Yusuke still makes me laugh. Ryuji is still endearingly dumb. Haru gets more screen time (thank god) and Makoto is still best girl. The new characters Sophia and Mr. Bloodborne (forgot his actual name) are lovely and fit in very well with the main group, with Sophia genuinely being my fourth favourite character (behind Yusuke, Makoto and Haru).\n\nTake this review lightly, as I've only beaten the 2nd Palace and I'm working through the 3rd one right now.

It's definitely a game I'd recommend to anyone who enjoyed Persona 5. It's a fun continuation with a good story and the Phantom Thieves hanging out and travelling across Japan. This might seem obvious, but if you weren't a fan of P5 then this game won't do much for you. Long stretches of cutscenes and characters the game expects you to be familiar with won't be too appealing if you haven't been sucked into the world of P5. Only other major complaint is the post-game, or lack thereof.

The things that were changed and made to be different to reflect upon its direction, such as the combat, is incredibly fun, rewards skill, and is something I found myself enjoying over the original turn-based formula that the Persona series is known for.\n\nIf you're looking for a less time-consuming Persona experience with a greater development into its combat than with time management around tasks and social links, then this should be up your alley. Despite the feeling of being a Persona-lite title, its gameplay loop is meaty and offers an incentive for fighting battles for stat boosters and a constant means of getting stronger. I'm playing NG+ on the hardest difficulty, and it's still feeling adequately challenging enough to keep me on my toes despite having Personas that would make the previous games into a laughing stock.\n\nIf you're unsure about getting it at full price, then be sure to pick it up when it's on a sale.

Gameplay is a surprising blend of those Warrior games (fight huge swathes of enemies who might throw in a few hits here and there) and Persona's weakness/resistance system. You have your basic combos that develop as you play each of the characters and you can bust out their Persona to do attacks that enemies are susceptible to, to knock 'em down and do an ALL OUT ATTACK that does huge damage to every enemy around. Each character has their own combo strings and variants that they learn as you play as them, so each one feels unique to each other, so try each one and they might fit your play style better than another, aside from worrying about weaknesses.\n\nPresentation is great, aside from some minor jagged edge problems that you can fix if you look up how (I've forgotten how exactly, it's been a while, but it also made everything else a tad funky). The stylization of characters and the world is still spot on to Persona 5 (no surprise), runs mostly well and of course the music is still S-tier at worst. You'll definitely have new favorites after playing through this.\n\nThe story and new characters are also pretty solid! I love both Sophie and Zenkichi, they're colorful additions that don't feel out of place with the core cast at all. They're well fleshed-out on top of the main P5 cast getting some more time that they hadn't before and also allowed for some more interactions among each of them. Only issue is that some of the villains of each new zone you get to explore aren't as fleshed out. One being familiar with a teammate and you don't really get much more than \"I thought you were good before, but now this happened and you're bad.\" to \"Ah, sorry about the sudden bad. We cool now?\" and then you leave. I mean you learn more than that, obviously, but it doesn't hit as strongly as some other characters developments. And those who played any spinoffs or the Royal version: it's focused on Persona 5. Old character portraits are used as opposed to the refreshed ones in Royal, Sumi doesn't exist in this timeline and neither does all the Royal specific changes to the story. Gonna miss Sumi, she was great and hope they push her in likely spinoffs, along with Zenkichi and Sophie but we'll see as unlikely as it is.\n\nAll in all, absolutely loved this game so much so I 100% it. A bit easier to do than core Persona 5, and on par with Persona 5 Royal. If you've played Persona 5 and loved it, absolutely hop onto this game. If you've played Persona 5 Royal and loved that, you'll be a bit saddened or confused, if that's the only version you played. Either way, it's excellent!\n\n(PS, IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING: RYUJI IS A POWERHOUSE, UTILIZE PLAYING AS HIM.)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "24252822adcd58218e042de228a7d059", "author": "310f01b2cbc05094a254dfca705ce96b", "date": "2021-11-27", "hours": 2230, "content": "Awesome Game!\nAlways loved the Persona series and Persona 5 was my favorite so far so I was glad to be able to experience more for the characters of the Phantom thieves.\n\nThe Gameplay is different from what I was used to with the main games but I enjoy it nevertheless. \nThe OST and artworks as well as designs are amazing as usual. \nNow I'm only hoping for P5 / P5R to be released for the PC as well \n\nAbsolutely love this!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09f9eb224dfc5bc0b7664b2a62e2fbce", "author": "73b6c9306f595d3894950a299d6fe56f", "date": "2021-11-27", "hours": 4532, "content": "The soundtrack and the visuals are still a masterpiece.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f3f9cc364040573fb17328a8b21cdad0", "author": "8569e7e40bd5511781b85f04ed5d2a87", "date": "2021-11-26", "hours": 2689, "content": "Looking cool, Joker!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ee00afb49f985484b38f2fae83a76712", "author": "2babdaf86f71529facc419b645e71bb1", "date": "2021-11-26", "hours": 1814, "content": "If you're looking for that itch after finishing the normal Persona 5.

It follows Joker and the Phantom Thieves as they traverse around Japan during their summer vacation with many exciting locales and palaces (jails) to explore and fight through! Anyone who has played the previous titles (P5/P5R) will understand many of the references made in this title.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat has been changed from turn based to a more dynasty warriors-esque 1 vs 100 type deal but still having the familiar persona combat system implemented in its RPG predecessor. Each member of the phantom thieves have their own unique persona to level up and as well as melee combos to learn which can be quite satisfying. Being able to see each member of the phantom thieves in combat fighting shadows alongside Joker is quite pleasing. Each individual character have a \"show-time\" ability that is built up through combat and it acts as a ultimate skill from each character's specific personas.\n\nWhile it took a little time to get used to, using personas in combat can be quite hectic since combat quite fast paced and would be more difficult if not for the time freeze when aiming skills over an area of enemies. Anyone who has played previous Persona or SMT titles will be familiar with the weakness system. Additionally fusion of personas (or  demons) returns again in this title with a more simplified system than it's predecessors.\n\nRPG elements:\nA lot of the social interactions between individual characters have been stripped out, in favor of a bond system that levels up and gives points for you to allocate into improving the phantom thieves team abilities as a whole. While there are still group events and small hang out events between characters that give you bond points and additional rewards for completing them all of the romance and dating systems in the main line games have been completely removed.\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a perfectly balanced game that takes the RPG elements of its predecessors and implements it well into a dynasty warriors type of game. While I do wish that social links were still a part of this game, the gameplay and story will easily keep any persona/SMT fan entertained for over 70 - 80 hours long depending on how much of a completionist you are.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c93b533cefad5a2dbebf8172cb574487", "author": "a96bbb06960f564d8139a822d6d8ee8a", "date": "2021-11-25", "hours": 691, "content": "I am a simp for Joker  :Mask4:", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c63cc258bd0b56b48348bc984185abec", "author": "2a57f08546ff569dad64df7dd4118d76", "date": "2021-11-25", "hours": 3323, "content": "alright now give us persona 5 on PC....

Anyone who knows me knows I love this installation in the series, and to have a direct sequel to the events of the game is just quite golden. I'm not nearly done with the game, but I've got enough time here to say that I'm pleased with how well this was made.\n\nI never expected that nearly every aspect of the game would be improved upon. The story is rich and drives in more development for the characters, songs have either been remixed and remastered to fit the action style (and nearly all of the new songs added are complete bops), and the style seen in P5 has been expanded upon and grown to a massive scale.\n\nThere are only a couple gripes I have. Very minor, but as it affects the gameplay itself, it feels rather sad to mention. I play this game for the story and music, but the gameplay was never all that engaging to me. Each of the fights had meperforming the same tactics, only changed by which boss I was going to face next. The bosses in this game are juggernauts, and it feels like they were only padded out just so that the in-fight dialogue could be heard. It just felt like there was too much health, and sometimes there were some really messed up moments between the AI and the bosses that just left you with almost nothing you could do (Hyodo without any tables left is a notable jerk that's for sure).\n\nOverall I enjoyed it, though.

Giant waves of enemies come at you and there's occasionally a boss who does big damage yet can be stunned for your own big damage if you hit it's weakness enough. Sounds like Persona/SMT gameplay in an action environment? You'd be correct.\n\nThere's balance issues with characters strengths and weaknesses but it never forces you into a unwinnable situation; plus the balance between Persona elements and beat-em-up elements was more important and they succeeded there. You have to keep an eye on your skills mostly for stronger enemies and to improve combos but if you're exceedingly talented at these kinds of games you could ignore it...but the system is fun so there's no reason to. The story is a bit shallow with our returning cast while the new faces (at least the good guys) get character development that's pretty logical and nice, but it probably won't leave the biggest impression on you. It's moreso a reason to see Ren, Ryuji, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba etc. again and get what would be confidant cut-scenes in P5 but stretched through the whole game. The game is  gorgeous and despite it being frantic I would stop after clearing an area to look around. I was worried when the characters looked a little off when it was revealed but they look fine in-game alongside the demons and levels you'll explore.\n\nIt's a fun sequel that doesn't push the envelope outside of introducing RPG menus and abilities to Samurai Warriors like gameplay. If you like Persona 5 it's a great. simple and significantly shorter. It allows extra time with the Phantom Thieves too, especially Haru! and don't worry - one thief won't take up a ton of the main plot this time. Makoto, I'm staring lazers at you. Gameplay design also feels similar despite the new combat style as managing your abilities before heading into a jail is where the real challenge comes in and then using those abilities sparingly. It's fun and enjoyable, do consider getting it!\n\nIf you don't like P5...you'll think it's pretty I guess. It's another warriors game with the ability to do an attack from a menu that does more damage.

The question I see about this game all the time is \"do I need to play Base Persona 5 to play this one?\" and yeah, I think you should. It takes place directly after, and while they don't touch on the story of P5 often, you still miss a lot of information on the characters and world, and if you go back to P5 later, a lot of stuff will be spoiled for you. Its not MANDITORY by any means, but enhances the game considerably. \n\nWith that out of the way, the game itself is a hack and slash game similar to the Warriors Series. And this is the first game with that combat I've consistently enjoyed. I've played Fire Emblem Warriors and Hyrule Warriors, and both of them get really REALLY boring after so many hours, but P5S keeps it fresh the whole way through, and is the only of this kind of game I've gone and 100%ed. The Demon Fusion elements from SMT are still present, but have been watered down considerably. This was a downside for me, but if you found the system tedious, this could be a good thing for you. Unless you're going for full completion, there is minimal grinding in this game, and the different ways to improve are all satisfying and fun to keep up with. The social aspect is all gone and the story is very streamlined, which makes it feel a lot less \"persona-y\" and the story is generally far more simple than anything else you'll see in this series, but the game never pretends to be more than it is. If you're coming for a simple button masher with some familiar faces and a cool world. you're in the right spot. But if you want a game that will make you feel the same way previous Persona games did, you're in the wrong spot. Overall if you liked P5 and want more. I'd recommend checking this one out. 6/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5e8b332ed49559d9b456642a8afb8df4", "author": "3c0efa1e862154a7951466e0664e35ce", "date": "2021-11-03", "hours": 765, "content": "Strongly recommended for any fan RPG fan.

It's really a story that doesn't need to be told.\n4. The music is bumping.\n\nPersona 5 is great. But this extra filler? Even the most die hard fans I think will be semi-let down over it. For example, Sophia and Old Man Zenkichi are not very charming. Finally, it has some of the lame changes of heart ever... Including someone semi-copying other peoples manga tropes and adding them to his own stupid manga.

First, it is a sequel / OVA so starting by the second entry is a bit silly, second a good half of the persona experience is your link with its cast of characters so, even if most of the mechanics of the story are re-explained, you would miss a lot a things, and persona 5 is one of the best games of last generation sooo...\n\nAnyway, presentation wise, exactly like its predecessor, this game is pristine, beautiful, inspired and varied environments, the music (again) is awesome, great animation works... It just radiates quality.\nSame thing in the writing department, the characters are as endearing as ever, and the additions to the thieves are very welcome, but the plot is a tad predictable sometimes.\nThe problem arises in the gameplay department, the moment-to-moment gameplay is clearly an experiment here, sometimes fighting can be tedious because of the stuck camera, lack of clarity, and the amount of enemies / time to dispatch them\u2026 when it\u2019s good it is really good you dodge and weave through the enemies with grace\u2026 until nothing shows you that another enemy is about to one shot from behind\u2026 Also, some jails (think palaces in p5) are a bit too big and revisiting them can be a bit tedious. The fusion system is a bit more tedious with level requirement for fusions components. And for the out of jail part, it is good, the confident system has been replaced by a much simpler system that allows you to unlock bonuses by collecting points doing requests (simple quests), after story event and during fighting, simpler but fitting for this much simpler game.\nAnyway, it is a quality game with some gameplay inconsistencies, though even though it is less good than its mainline entry, I enjoyed it a great deal and if you liked p5 you should too!

They\u2019re so well-written, realistic-sounding and mature. And they\u2019ve grown from when we last met them, showing empathy to their adversaries. You\u2019ll cheer when they get their big damn hero moment. How could I not take the opportunity to spend another 100 hours with these kids? And on a cross-Japan road trip too? Say less.\n\nIt\u2019s almost unfair to call Strikers a musou game, despite being one, as it doesn\u2019t feel like a Dynasty Warriors game at all. For as much as I love Koei Tecmo\u2019s tentpole action series, Strikers\u2019 combat is too slick and too varied, and too stylistically Persona to be called a typical musou.

[/b] Outside of that, it is just you doing missions with a main character who, while wildly loved by the series' respective fans, is not the reason people play Warrior games. To have a single-digit number of characters that can be played, and only after some time, in a title like this is embarrassing and really highlights the shortcomings of the rest of the game.\n\n[b] Artistic style is not an excuse for fun. [/b]\n\nAt the end of the day, a fresh coat of paint isn't an excuse for a lack of content. It looks very pretty, yes. True to the series for artistic choice? Yes. Does it add anything else? No. It seems the majority of production on this game went into pressing out another story in the Persona Universe without actually making the game around the new action-based mechanics.\n\nDon't get it unless you merely want to continue the Persona fandom.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 10, "funny": 4, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "84b89a19acac5b408ab27b0e497e7fe0", "author": "9f9bf68e4683594490a7f82e44da494f", "date": "2021-09-22", "hours": 523, "content": "Ok, its a good game but Atlus...

I would prefer to give this a mixed review over a negative review, but people only read the negative reviews.\n\nIf you're buying this, then you have probably already played P5/P5R (and if you haven't, there's really nothing here for you). It's pretty much just a lot of fan service tied together with an okay story, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. The gameplay loop is novel at first if you're coming from the slow, turnbased combat of the mainline games, but gets very boring and repetitive towards the later half of the game. I used Cheat Engine to get more XP and lowered the difficulty because the game expects you to grind to level up all your characters even on the lowest difficulty, which is frankly silly. \n\nThe fanservice is enjoyable, but they cheaped out on a lot of the smaller interactions. For example, in mainline Persona 5, if you ate ramen with Ryuji in your free time, there'd be at least some action-figure-like animations accompanying you eating ramen. In this game, it just gives you a black screen with Ryuji telling you how delicious the ramen is. It's not great, but this is only for the minor interactions and nothing else really reaches that level of laziness.\n\nThat said, if you understand this is just a spinoff with none of the major Persona mechanics and just want to have more time with the Phantom Thieves, this might be worth it- on sale.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09da944bee45574dadfecaa0fd442315", "author": "6cf86c65d312563e9312a757919a3f1b", "date": "2021-09-18", "hours": 3872, "content": "It's a sequel with great story and an actual continuation to the original Persona 5's (also great) story, but of course doesn't play like the original game.

Without doing extra side stuff like requests, or secret bosses the game might only take about 20 hours to complete, which my play-through with doing those things (plus some save scumming for specific side objectives) i finished the game at around 35 hours, which is not reflected in my Steam playtime as I was alt-tabbed out of the game a lot. I've not played many Musou games (only two being both Hyrule Warriors spin-offs as well) but for a crowd fighting game it's really weird the most you'll fight at a time is 3-15 enemies, with bigger crowds only available in scripted events, filled with generic no weakness enemies.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7d21669270495c79b52ecef9d7c26bd7", "author": "1ab6cb31820d5242a699e389adb18b58", "date": "2021-09-16", "hours": 2032, "content": "This game slaps.

There's something lacking on the gameplay loop, I find it hard to gather motivation to comeback to this game.\n\nI'm a huge Persona fans so I'm a bit sad I can't like this game, I tried to push the end because I want to see what's the story had to offer. This is not a bad game, its a decent game but I need to push my self to finish it unlike other Persona games.\n\n[h2]Good story and Character[/h2]\nOne of the good aspect in this game is the story, it's not as good as P5 Royal's third semester but it's an enjoyable story. It started with formulaic story but after the monotonous story done, it's an enjoyable story. The new cast on this game is the highlight of this game, his story is good and enjoyable, it had soul and might touch your heart. I really enjoy his story.\n\n[h2]Great Music[/h2]\nI like the soundtrack of this game, my favorite one is \"Daredevil\" and \"Counter Strike\". This game had really good music like you would expect from any persona games. The music gives so much vibe in this game, for example the \"Daredevil\" is feel like \"I'm stylishly unstoppable\" when striking toward towers and \"Counter Strike\" feel like \"a smooth badass\". It's pretty good\n\n[h2]This is a decent game for returning fans, but its not a good game for new comers[/h2]\nThis game contains every team member already finished their character development on P5 so there's no many growth worth mentioning, many stuff in this game will appeal to the fans but might confuse new comer.\n\n[h2] There's a good mechanic, but gameplay wise, I can't say many good thing about it[/h2]\nThere's a good mechanic like allowing you to swap to previously learned skill on your persona and cooking. I'm a huge Persona fans and find this entry quite underwhelming. It's still feel like Persona 5, character and story wise its good but gameplay wise is meh.\n\n[h2]SP & HP management is bad in this game[/h2]\nOne of the most fun challange in Persona game is HP and SP management and this spin off made it a nuisance. On the original game, you need to manage your resource efficiently, if you fail to do so you'll lost 1 day worth of free time it's a pretty clever mechanic. On this spin off there's no penalty, to recover your resource just simply go out and go to dungeon again while doing it you need to watch 3 loading screen, it's such a pain to do. This game should've had 1 button to recover HP & SP instead of doing that stupid clunky way.\n\n[h2]Decent UI, bad UX[/h2]\nI hate the UX in this game. The UI is decent but the UX is bad. The most obvious thing is unskippable transition, it such a spit in the face to the original P5 UX. To do something you need to watch TRANSITION, it's unskipable and slow it makes doing everything in the main menu feel sluggish, I hate it. It's so bad compared to P5 which is very concise, stylish, responsive, fast and clearly designed with player in mind. Pretty sure the designer in this game should learn from Masayoshi Sutoh and Hisayoshi Kijima (the UI designer of Persona 5 and Nier: Automata).\n\n[h2]Stripped Velvet Room[/h2]\nThe velvet room is a stripped down version of the original, I don't like it. It feels limited and it lacks the charm of the velvet room.\n\n[h2]The Persona skill is not well designed and battle is a bit mindless[/h2]\nA simple case: \"maragi\" previously it used to attack fire to all enemy in front of you, this lead to many interesting decision like:\n[list]\n[*] \"should I save sp or damage everyone with fire?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that drain fire, is it worth to attack everything but some of them gain health?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that reflect fire, is it worth to attack everything but I take damage?\"\n[*] \"should I finish this battle in 1 turn or wait for the next few turn?\"\n[*] etc\n[/list]\nBut in this game, maragi just simply attack wider range. It doesn't effect anything, there's no interesting decision its just a mindless skill. This not only happen to maragi skill but happen to buff/debuff and the gambling hama skill.

I have finished the game but for some reason I forgot to write a review for this amazing game . So , let me begin by saying that if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal ,stay way  from this game at all costs  if you don't want your experience to be ruined (If you have specific questions about that ask  me in the comments and i will  try to explain  as much  spoiler free as possible) . Since  I am afraid that I might spoil  something and the fact that  English is not my mother tongue language , I will be short  :\nPros  : \n- Soundtrack :  Even though  this is a sequel/spin off and clearly I thought that the budget is gonna be less , I expected that  the quality  would not be as good as Persona 5/Royal , the game absolutely  destroyed my negative expectations . I can safely say that the quality of the different songs of  this game were on par with the soundtrackk of Persona 5 if not better . And  Lyn Inaizumi with her superb tone and really good control on the high notes, a great overall performance as always . Give her some love please on Twitter .\n- Engine : I really don't know what Engine did they use on Persona 5 strikers but  the textures for characters ,objects,game terrain are light  years more clean than the  Persona 5 Royal (which have a slight upgrade on it's graphics in comparison with  the vanilla Persona 5) . And  even though this is anime or as some smart people like to say it ''a weeb'' game , the game looks soooooooo good in 4K  60 fps and everything  on the highest  settings to the  point that I could not believe it . \n-Gameplay: At first ,  when it first was announced for the Japanese market I thought that the gameplay will be  broken , poorly made or whatever you want to call . And I was sure (for some reason) that this type  of gameplay will absolutely not  fit well on a Persona game so decided to ignore it since I believed that it won't have a Western release . After some time when the game was announced for the West , I decided  to take the risk (due to my bias towards the Persona franchise and Atlus)  and preorder the digital deluxe . So the early access released  and  I started playing . Not only it is not boring  but it also has so many many creative mechanics that build on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay  formula and make it wayyyyy more fun  than I expected and it  felt so good using the different new  mechanics  .\n-Story (SPOILER FREE) : Even though I have the bias i already mentioned above  ,  I never expected the story of this spin off (which also servers a sequel to Persona 5) to be so well crafted . Of course , not as big (that\u2019s what she said) and good as the Persona but so much better than your everyday spinn off \n-Duration/NG+ : First of all , the playtime I currently have is not  accurate because I have spent  1-2 hours looking  at the preorder bonuses . Also this is the duration of my first playthough and I haven't started yet NG+ .  NG+  is neccessary if you want to earn al the achievements . I am the type of player that likes to look every nook and cranny of the game , unlock  all the abilities for the characters , do all the side quests first  and then start doing the main story to unlock new side quests (and repeat ) until I finish the game  . \n Cons: \nThe only  thing I didn't like was the epilogue(it was rushed in my opinion but it probably they didn't have the apropriate budget to make it  smoother , I can't be  sure )  and fact that [spoiler] you can predict after a certain point  in the main story who the main antagonist is so I wish they would have hidden this person  better but it didn't bother me that much . Don't make that stop you from buying it , it is just my personal whining [/spoiler]\n\nOoof , I wrote more than I expected . Before  I  leave please leave  a comment if you  have anything to ask before buying in the comments .

Never would have imagined that my wish would come true!\n\nWell, sort of, at least. Story-wise, [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is indeed a sequel (although most of the side characters from [i]P5[/i] are absent, and don\u2019t expect to develop/continue any romantic relationships, either), however, the battle system is quite different this time around. I, for one, wasn\u2019t a huge fan of this new, active, real-time combat. Sure, you can get used to it pretty fast, it\u2019s not very difficult, controls are pretty fluid, and it can definitely be fun obliterating huge hordes of enemies \u2013 it\u2019s just that I, personally, have always preferred turn-based battles in JRPGs. \n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, there\u2019s nothing I could complain about. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, including all the beautiful anime cutscenes, the story is meaningful (although maybe a bit weaker than in [i]P5[/i]) filled with relatable characters, and the music\u2026 God, I loved the music, just like in all [i]Persona[/i] games I\u2019ve played so far! Admittedly, most of the songs are from [i]P5[/i], but I didn\u2019t mind that at all. I\u2019m telling you, the soundtracks of these games are incredible.\n\nAll in all, even if you\u2019re like me and are a bit intimidated by the battle system, I think you should give this one a try.

I highly recommend playing through it first before Strikers.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a sequel/spinoff to Persona 5. Unlike it's predecessor which was a turn based jrpg with dungeon crawler/social sim elements, Strikers is an action hack and slash game in the vein of Dynasty Warriors.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this game is how familiar to Persona 5 it feels. It has so many little touches like the player being able to pause the game and view the dialogue log mid conversation. All of the player's companions return from the original which is a very welcome inclusion. As a huge fan of Persona 5's story and characters the primary selling point for this game was being able to continue the adventures of Joker and the gang. Which this game delivers. On the flipside this is also potentially the game's greatest shortcoming. It's a direct sequel to Persona 5 and fully expects you to have beaten that game before playing this one. Considering Persona 5 isn't on Steam (as of the writing of this review anyway) this is a massive problem. Because of that if you haven't previously played P5 or P5R you will be rather lost in terms of the story and general gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe action rpg combat is serviceable albeit very simple. It feels kind of mindless at times and selectively makes you pay attention when it throws a challenging enemy at you. It does feel like the developers did their best to try and make an action rpg out of Persona 5's combat. However I never felt like it ever surpassed that game in terms of strategy or personality. I can see this game appealing to people who were turned off of Persona 5's turn based combat. However because it's story expects you to have beaten P5 it also doesn't really appeal to newcomers. \n\nAll in all in terms of being a spinoff/sequel to Persona 5 it delivers. It gives you more of that game just with a different spin on things. Outside of that though if you weren't crazy about the original like I was it's hard to recommend. Especially since Persona 5 isn't on Steam as of yet. Hopefully if/when that game releases, Strikers can have a second wind on Steam. But til then it remains as a novelty for the minority of PS4 owners who own a gaming PC and were also huge fans of Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "84806d68d90b54b0b01131779c6b8b2b", "author": "e10c3af8ceca57ccbed4dde247750142", "date": "2021-09-01", "hours": 228, "content": "Game itself is amazing", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f5510ea4508e53be8a05243a684a9fe1", "author": "2247a984acfc564c9bfc809ce1a8cc1f", "date": "2021-08-31", "hours": 5642, "content": "\"spin-off\"\nfinished after 95hrs steam time.\nyeaaaaaaaaaaaaa-----aaaaaaa", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c4daa33e362b5a8989b82a876fa15c91", "author": "5dd8bc4eba7358d2b75def6e0cfa035a", "date": "2021-08-31", "hours": 3079, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers overall does a fantastic job of bringing P5's characters and gameplay to a whole new style of combat.  Fights are smooth, the combos are satisfying, and it still feels like Persona combat.  Elemental affinities are still present, and Joker can freely swap between available Personas.  Every playable character feels unique and has a moveset I feel accurately represents them.  For example, Morgana can transform into his car form seen in Mementos, and several of Makoto's combos involve riding Johanna or rapid punches.  The story overall was pretty good and helped make this still feel like a Persona game.  The Phantom Thieves are rather static characters compared to the original game, but instead they help others find their own way, especially the two new members of the Thieves.  However the first few Jails can feel rather...samey and formulaic.  It doesn't help that every boss fight takes place in a castle.  It loses some of the uniqueness seen in P5's Palaces.  I also don't think the Jail Monarchs have the same impact as Palace rulers, but there were good ones.  \n\nOne major returning part of the game to really tie it back to the Persona series is the Velvet Room.  Lavenza alone manages it this time as Igor is nowhere to be seen.  And this was honestly what I felt to be the weakest part of the game.  Especially coming nearly fresh off of Persona 5 Royal, the Velvet Room felt very bare bones.  Persona Fusion works in pretty much the same way, but there's not much else.  You gain the ability to level your Personas directly up to Joker's current level with a new currency, but it gets very expensive very quickly.  Not helped are the new restrictions that the Personas themselves now must be at a certain level to be fused.  This wasn't a big deal in the early game, but trying to get powerful Personas in the late game was a chore as they often required Personas acquired in early Jails to be at a level far past when they stop learning new skills.  For example, King Frost requires Jack Frost and Jack-o-Lantern to be at level 40 while Joker to be at level 66.  But Jack-o-Lantern might be around level 8.  So the only way to get him the extra levels is to spend the new persona points.  But I at least could not find a reliable way of getting them besides re-summoning and dismissing high level Personas.  Gaining new Personas in the field is random; there is a chance a defeated Shadow will drop a mask for Joker, and that chance can be increased by leveling a skill.  Repeated Personas will give persona points instead of exp like in P5.\n\nOverall this is still a very fun game with fantastic music and a decent story, but I think Persona 5 Royal is the more polished experience.  But for a spin-off sequel in a totally different genre?  It did a great job.\n\nOne last note: the digital deluxe edition is slightly misleading.  The art gallery and OST are locked in a separate application with no built-in way to download the contents.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8ce5c42213525db48fac3684495d45cd", "author": "b9cf43af4f8a5936bece72d859adf803", "date": "2021-08-28", "hours": 4593, "content": "Calling this game a spinoff of Persona 5 would be a disservice. Despite a huge difference in gameplay Persona 5 Strikers feels more like a proper sequel. Not only that but I can wholeheartedly say that I had more fun with P5S than with the vanilla Persona 5.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, at its core, is a Musou type game with Persona mechanics. Meaning, a hack'n'slash with hundreds of enemies and some RPG elements. And surprisingly such combination works very well. The production values are quite impressive, with a brand new story reuniting the Phantom Thieves together, as well as introducing some well-developed new characters. The way the characters interact feels like a proper Persona game, and while the core story isn't anything groundbreaking, it is still very well presented, with some nice twists here and there. Honestly, I think I enjoyed the story more than the vanilla Persona 5, mainly because the characters we interact with are not just simple one-dimensional villains like in the original.\n\nDespite lacking the social-life aspect of previous Persona titles, many other elements unique to that series are present in Strikers. And the action-oriented gameplay works very well with them. Kind of brings back memories of the Devil Summoner series from the PS2, only better and even more dynamic. With several different playable and customizable characters, as well as dozens of Personas to fuse for the main character, the hack'n'slash gameplay doesn't get tedious too fast. Mashing buttons won't get you far, as there's still a need to be tactical and aware of enemies' affinities. That said, even though I'm no action game expert, I've found the controls to be very intuitive and comfortable. Rarely had any issues controling the characters or running around the environment.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. The style is very similar to Persona 5, and the new music is very catchy, whether in battle, dungeons, or during free-time. Environments are numerous and varied. This goes for both the dungeons and the Japanese cities the party visits during their trip.\nThe game runs at 60fps and the PC port is honestly surprisingly good. Never had a single technical issue and the game ran very smoothly with no frame drops whatsoever.\n\nWhereas the original Persona 5, for me, got tedious very fast, I've found Persona 5 Strikers way more enjoyable. To the point I've started the New Game + on the highest difficulty only to appreciate it even more. Sure, there are some flaws, obviously, but my point is that the game is really good and every fan of Persona 5 should give it a try. Other people maybe not so much, mainly because Strikers is a direct sequel to Persona 5, which I'd suggest either play or watch beforehand.\n\nOverall, a great game that doesn't deserve to be called a spinoff, because it's much more than that.

The OST is S tier per usual when it comes to a persona game with some twists on some of the classic Persona 5 songs giving them some extra flair and energy that felt much needed for a musou game.

Whether you like this game or not will depend on what you liked in Persona 5 more, which is either the life-sim/story or the gameplay or both. \n\nAlso btw, this is a full-on sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) so I would highly recommend playing that one first. Not just because it gives you more insight into the characters but it is also a better put together game, albeit with its weaknesses which P5S has seemed to borrowed over as well.\n\nIt is definitely a game made for people who have played and fell in love with Persona 5 before. Great music, great characters (new ones too) with an interesting amalgamation of both the combat styles, but highly leaning towards the use of Personas in the active battlefield. I was no longer waiting 120 seconds per turn to think about my next 3 moves, like what I would do in Persona 5. Now you have to make split second decisions, but you can always open up the persona menu mid-battle to pause time and think about your strategy a bit. Some levels are poorly balanced so feel free to adjust the difficulty if you retry more than twice on a mission, unless you are in it for the challenge.\n\n1. My biggest problem with this game is the same problem that I had with P5.\n\nThe story and the pace of it is just too slow at some points especially in the middle, where you feel like the story is not progressing anywhere and we are basically waiting for something to happen/give us a clue. Some dungeons are just too big, and they throw the same enemy types at you and you steamroll through them till you reach a boss which spices up some things but largely uses the same skills, tactics etc. Lots of potential here to make you feel burned out and bored if you figure out some strategies which work in the short term.\n\n2. My second biggest problem, I don't think the game puts enough emphasis on using persona skills that automatically trigger when you execute a particular combo. This is especially helpful with Joker since he is the most versatile one and using the skills in combos drains 0 SP, so you still get some chance to retaliate at low SP. It's basically a weakened version of a skill but takes no SP. SP is still a rarely found resource in the game and especially when there is no checkpoints to save your progress and refresh your SP in sight.\n\n3. Third, I feel the story and dungeons were too repetitive and simplistic this time. The story repeated itself for 3-4 dungeons (these were the long ones too imo). Go to the dungeon, chase the red marker, kill everything that stands in your way. I saw this in P5 as well so I think it carried on from there but the most complex things that the dungeon crawling in P5 and P5S require from you are simple yet gloried fetch quests. I would have liked to see the dungeon crawling requires at least 10% of my brain power to clear through them.\n\n4. This point is deriving info heavily from the P5 story so most of this is in spoiler territory. [spoiler]The plot lacks originality. The story is pretty similar to P5 (the characters say that they have seen this happen themselves). The bosses have more backstory this time so that's nice but still it seems pretty formulaic by the time the story tries to create suspense because the pacing issues I mentioned up there. Zenkichi and Sophia are welcome additions to the crew however. I think Zenkichi's addition should have happened sooner that it did because the plot picks up after that point quickly. The pacing issues is something I really hope ATLUS improves on because plenty of people just leave games when they get boring or some people just stop paying attention to the stuff going on (like me during the mid-game).[/spoiler]\n\nEven after all my criticisms, I feel this game deserves a genuine try by Persona fans because there's still plenty of things to love here, especially Persona 5 fans like me.

Yes, it is a continuation of P5 (one of my favorite JRPGs), but the choice of combat style a la Dynasty Warriors seemed a weird choice for me. Indeed, it took quite some getting used to at first. Many of the battles will present you with so much information on screen that it can be difficult to keep track of what is happening. Hordes of enemies swarm and remembering certain attack combos in unison with summoning your Persona felt like a feat in multitasking compared to the original combat of P5; though this may be more my lack of experience with hack and slash games if anything. Showtime attacks, which felt like more of an after-thought in Royal, return center stage akin to ultimate moves in combat, with each part member having their own unique set. Persona summoning is also incorporated into combat, with the ability to switch between your deck and cast spells as needed.\n\nHowever, after a while, the combat became fun once I grew accustom to the controls. Playing this on PC, I would highly recommend plugging in a controller over M&K. There was something satisfying in the flashy and stylish way each Phantom Thief performs in a fight. Beyond the main combat, it keeps to the series' traditional Persona fusing system (complete with Velvet Room), along with the same familiar abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Any veteran of the Persona will pick up on these with ease. \n\nThe gameplay takes place in various \"Jails,\" similar to Palaces where they are tied to and modeled after a particular boss. Even after completion, you can revisit each one to tie up loose ends such as obtaining a rare Persona or completing side jobs that will occasionally come in. Another change is lack of Confidants or daily social activities in favor of focusing largely on the main group. Because of this change, late additions to the party in P5, such as Futaba or Haru, receive a lot more screen time. \n\nIn terms of story, this game is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (vanilla, not Royal). The Phantom Thieves reunite to tackle another threat as they travel Japan in a grand road trip. The Metaverse returns and, unsurprisingly, someone is messing with it again. It follows much of the same structure as P5 in finding the current big bad, taking them down, and moving on to the next target. Strikers deviates from the main game in that you no longer have major hub areas to explore outside of the Metaverse. Most new location only come with minor exploration, with most of the meat being within the Jails themselves. In-game time is fast-tracked in comparison, with typically only a few 'days' between missions. No new formula here, but if you're looking for more Phantom Thieves goodness, this game will offer it. The game is not nearly as long as its predecessor; I finished at about 54 hours, which included a bit of time building my Persona team and tackling various side jobs/bosses. \n\nMost of the same beats are here: stylistic combat, great music, an engrossing story, and the same lovable cast of characters. There is not much more to say beyond that, as anyone coming out of P5 will feel at home here (at least once mastering the combat system). While not as grand as those of the main line games, it is a worthy sequel to try something new and help pass the time waiting for P6.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6ebed30cf29451369365e2d37212ef6f", "author": "e0aec753d3105d36a6a0a914e8d37ef0", "date": "2021-08-11", "hours": 198, "content": "I was expecting a generic musou game with Persona paint and I would've been happy, this is so much better than that.

Konoe as Shido-adjace (even down to the boss fight mechanics), Demiurge being character-wise a repeat of Yaldabaoth, and the final 2 jails being Mementos-adjace left me a little let down by the final 3 or so hours of the game.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Overall: A good, almost-great sequel to P5.[/h1]", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "056a2cf9679c55f0abd1dcc3d61349eb", "author": "bcab3ee5f1805d208eaaff2a73e6444b", "date": "2021-08-11", "hours": 2799, "content": "Legitimately improves on a bunch of plot and character development issues that Persona 5 had, unless you really liked all those scenes where the bad guys talk about how evil they are.\n\nNew music is pretty good, old stuff is reused.

Most battles on higher difficulties turn into you spamming SP because there's no way in hell you're beating some of these bosses otherwise. Stronger moves cost a large amount of SP, unless you have certain Persona abilities. Be ready to chug sodas or other SP restoration items. I definitely advise playing on easy so the combat doesn't start to drag and bosses don't take a long time. The combo versions of spells just don't cut it.  At all. You'll either get knocked out of it or get it off and deal basically no damage. Combat basically comes down to this cycle: heat riser -> apply status -> spam technicals and/or weakness -> recover SP. I've tried several times to play the game any other way and the payoff is never worth it. The moment I got Spell Master, the other party members might as just not exist. \n\nOkay, now that the bummer part is out of the way. The story is great! The new characters fit in perfectly and I want more of them. The old cast bounce off of each other and the new characters very well! The music is incredible and a lot of boss designs and set pieces are really good. \n\nThe quality of life for Persona abilities is great and definitely should be added to the main games going forward. Merciless drops items that increase a stat by 1 so other party members can achieve 99 in all stats, which is pretty satisfying. Fusion is a little lack luster, requiring some persona to be very high leveled and there's just not that many to fuse. Persona take forever to level, and using the persona points system is really tedious. You essentially buy and release the same persona over and over to get more persona points. The ultimate persona is just Lucifer, which is a bummer given the potential of P5's ultimate Persona in this game.\n\nYou probably won't encounter these issues unless you play on hard or normal, and you'll definitely avoid most of the fusion issues if you aren't achievement hunting like I was.

In fact, if I had to complain it's almost too similar to P5. This is true for gameplay, atmosphere, and even story--it hits many of the same beats, including a couple of the more tiresome ones.

You REALLY should play through the original/royal before diving into this one as its a follow on from the main storyline of that game. That said it does NOT follow on from Royal's extra 3rd semester content so if you have gotten to the 3rd semester that does not apply here as this game was made at the same time as Royal. Albeit as of the time of making this review neither the original or Royal have been ported to PC yet so you will have to wait if you are PC only and pray that Atlus does port it after the success from Persona 4 golden's port. Personally i played through both on PS4 (Combined total hours of over 230 for Persona 5 and Royal, Yes i love that game so much i played through it twice despite its monstrous length).  Took me a little bit of time (about half way through the first jail)  to fully get used to the Musou style of gameplay as this is my first game of that type of playstyle but once i got into it its great stuff, The mixture of persona and that style of gameplay blends well in my opinion. Storyline is good for the most part (some parts may feel a little bit lacking but its still a good game) and there's a mixture of sizes for the jails. 4 are Longer more fleshed out ones while the other 4 are shorter and in some cases much shorter mostly for some storyline purposes. Kyoto's jail makes up for its length with a great ending boss fight though its a shame you can't refight it like the others. While some of the shorter jails are a little disappointing length wise this did not hinder my overall enjoyment of the game and its nice to have a persona game that isn't so insanely long. Albeit this game still has good length and it did take me some time to finish all the requests and main story etc and post game content as i like to take my time with games. Music as usual when it comes to persona games is fantastic and the game looks decent in a higher resolution.

I.E. you can set controls for when you are in battle, but if you want to use that same button in the \"normal world\" you CANT. The game will unmap the button from when you are fighting.\n\nThis practically forces you to use the default keybindings, which suck so much that the game is borderline unplayable.\n\n\n\n[b]The music[/b]\nWhat for me was a BIG reason why i finished P5R was the incredible music. Sure there were a few bad songs, think about mementos and okumura's palace, but mostly, the OST was great! Now in P5S the difference between good songs and bad songs is amplified. There are a few absolute bangers like daredevil, the intro, and the remix of last surprise. But sadly, at least three of the songs that i had really wished that would've been gone remain. (Tension, Blood of Villain, High Pressure (seriously, fuck this song))\n\nOverall for the music, 8/10.

From the boss fights with dialogue that you CANNOT focus on because the battles are now in real time instead of turn based which WILL make you miss story, to you being able to fully heal with no penalty whatsoever just by returning to the overworld and going back and the general clunky controls of some of your abilities... yeah, it doesn't work.\n\nClunky controls and poor game design choices. Yikes.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nYes i realize that i've barely played the game and that i'm nowhere near finishing it, but from what i'm seeing right now, this is not good. Unengaging, boring and plot-hole filled storytelling that does not address any of what happened during P5/P5R. Not for me.\n\nIt's short enough that you should just read it.\nPlease do tell me if the story gets better after the first palace, cause if it doesn't i don't think i'll finish the game.\n\n\nI'll definitely keep listening to some songs in the OST, and i love the opening, but i just can't see myself finishing this game any time soon.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fae265085c6056109aacf113c46fc7a5", "author": "e637c55933775a53ba6f08fb2c4ab42c", "date": "2021-07-27", "hours": 2697, "content": "Expected another musou style game with my favorite characters and came out surprised by how cool the game was.

The combat felt very satisfying and the story was overall fantastic, even the music was phenomenal. It was indeed a perfect execution of using a new genre for the series. The Persona series never seems to disappoint and I'm glad to enjoy the ride of this series. My verdict of this game will be a solid 9/10. The reasoning for the 9 is just because as much as this game is fantastic, I could definitely see some potential of including DLC like having Akechi or Kasumi as DLC Characters or maybe challenge packs like they did with protagonist of 3 and 4 that was seen in Royal where you can fight them and maybe gain their fusions to make their Personas.

I do a pros and cons type of review so I can make it as simple as possible. Now onto the pros\n\n[Pros]\n\n- [Combat]\nI love this games feel for the hack and slash type of game style they did not miss on the feel of combat and the enjoyment of constantly throwing out attacks and dodging.\n\n- [Bond] In the previous persona 5 it was done through spending time with characters and unlocking better skills, In this game it is gained through requests and story progression and is very neat upgrading the exact skills you want to.\n\n- [Personas]\nThey kept a lot of the old personas making it pretty fun seeing the old ones and knowing how to counter them off of memory from the previous game. I also like how in combat you can use the ability's as a combo that doesn't consume SP making the personas more involved since they branched more into melee combat it kept the feel of needing personas relevant.\n\n- [Requests]\nI seen a request and it allowed me to re fight a boss of a jail for a reward which was pretty dope not having to start a new game plus just to fight a certain boss again, which in turn gives the game more replay value without having to new game plus it.\n\n- [Fast Paced Combat] \nI enjoy running around and just slashing at every enemy in sight it makes for a more involved experience so you don't fall asleep while grinding levels as fast.\n\n- [Sequel]\nUnlike jumping from character to character when making a new game they instead made it like a sequel which was promising since I never played the other personas I wanted to relive the feel of the OG phantom thieves in persona 5. Making me want it all the more and I mention this because I have a con later down in the list making this make more sense to the rating.\n\n- [Art Style]\nIt's very unique in the environment inside the metaverse which I can appreciate a very lot since it makes it stand out from other games it makes you wanna keep playing the franchise.\n\nThis is my temporary review since I haven't fully played through and only have 10 hours into the game now onto the cons.\n\n[Cons]\n\n- [Sequel]\nSo far into my gameplay I haven't experienced much freedom which may be because I'm not far enough into the game, I really enjoyed the dating whoever you wanted or deciding what to do with your time. It strayed from the feel of persona 5 which makes this sequel a bit of a disappointment though this is a temporary review so this might change as I get further into the game and comments are enabled so if anyone wants to comment on this explaining how the freedom works I would appreciate that. I very rarely get time to play so it may be awhile till I get to see how it is.\n\n- [EXP] \nI fight almost every single enemy I find and I am still not a high level to where I can go through the area like its on very easy difficulty and that is not very promising for a time limited game time.\n\n- [Time Management]\nThe previous persona made entering and exiting the palaces and mementos much more problematic in this game they don't really worry you since you can go in and out as you please and your days won't end. It completely heals you and your sp is returned making it a lot less fun trying to survive on no hp or sp or even being tactical on how you use your sp/items.\n\nI do think this game will open up a lot of pros as I progress and this one specifically might just start slow but I will be back to update this review as I learn more things about the game.\nAnd this is the end of the review to all the people that stayed and read my review thank you and I hope you have a great day/night :3", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ff8bde8926fb5ebd902ed4d1ada90c90", "author": "fb0ab7ecb92e548a82133e8b6d61f414", "date": "2021-07-15", "hours": 449, "content": "the cat turns into a bus", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fc24f386ad78567d88dd60a479b9c042", "author": "488d2fadacdf52f38224e4e0ffae068e", "date": "2021-07-15", "hours": 313, "content": "Holy fuck this is the closest we are gonna get to P5 on PC", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b34c036c0bec59548ea66c748e54f648", "author": "bd37cc9e48445e4fa16cfd8cbc881020", "date": "2021-07-15", "hours": 2553, "content": "It was a lot of fun getting the Phantom Thieves back together in this game.

No characters,events or ending are mentioned or seen in Strikers from Royal. Bare that in mind. It is a must to know the lore of Persona 5. Either play it or watch a no commentary walkthrough. Anime is not recommended as many things are lost.\n\nStrikers had a drastic change in gameplay from Turn base combat to Hack and Slash which made the game more fast paced and gives you a big window of how you will fight with shadows. As we might remember, Yakuza Like a Dragon also changed it's combat but to Turn Based which was not the best decision.\n\nNow we roam all around Japan to find Jails (Yes, now castles are called jails and they are not a little location but a whole city) and defeat Monarchs that rule them. There is no Memento for obvious reasons. \n\nThe game became very easy in comparison to the previous game. You are not limited with time anymore and can infiltrate jails as many times as you want. You don't need to raise your confidants anymore because there is a new system of Bond. You receive Bond Skill exp for battles,requests,bosses and so. You get points with each level that you can spend on skills that will help you in different ways. The shop is now a;ways in the hideout. One click and you can buy anything you want. You don't need to annoy poor Iwai for equipment or go to Takemi for meds. Ah, you will be hearing \"How many?\" and \"Are you sure?\" a looooooooooot of times, so be prepared. I warned you.\n\nThe story is as always good but there is one moment in the game which makes me question why the devs repeated themselves...\n\nBosses. If you played or watched Persona 5, you do remember that each boss was unique and you had to follow some strategy not to die. Sadly, bosses here are like regular enemies. Nothing special about them. No difficult stategy needed. You just need to mash the buttons and evade. Only the final boss was unique and had something different in the boss fight. \nI'll just give an example of Persona 5 boss. Madarame. Several phases. Painting and then fight with clones where you had to use correct skills to win. Here...just mash the down buttons. Maybe it was made so the game doesn't loose the pace and stays fast like all of the gameplay but these are bosses. When you beat them, you need to get the feeling that you won by doing something and getting the feeling that all the hours you spent to grind for a new persona wasn't just a woosh. \n\nIn general I like the game and it's new combat system. New locations were a nice change of pace and I hope the next game will have something more. Bosses need more attention because this is just a meh. I hope that the new game will have another cool story that I and other Persona fans will enjoy.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e6d415f2d53c5535a859fd84f638f1a1", "author": "ee4bbae78e9957bfaf6ca7f6c8d3ca8d", "date": "2021-07-10", "hours": 1133, "content": "Boring gameplay.\nStory on rails.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5d87dc1e0b30559791be2081807b06d4", "author": "d340bb7f3e27570e8a872d1f1caf7892", "date": "2021-07-10", "hours": 188, "content": "Very fun game, great graphics", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "42f3dd0132a056b8be6752c512411212", "author": "678dbe19b1875355b4457759dc395297", "date": "2021-07-10", "hours": 3877, "content": "Seems they focused more on the combat and less on the role playing compared to the original Persona 5.\n\nStill a great game overall.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "420d18fd90755f8c850b153e9dd7d2ad", "author": "9d1694dddfb153b790b611754d8c6c67", "date": "2021-07-10", "hours": 138, "content": "Very nice.

I don't care if you have to watch an LP.\n\nAs a huge Persona 5 fan, I preordered this game and completed the story 4 days after it came out, playing nothing but this game. While it is significantly shorter than the original Persona 5, I can say that the combat is some of the most fun I've *ever* had in a game. You can totally feel the passion from this game, and the developers put their heart and soul into making something that will stay true to the Persona 5 vibe and the charm that made people fans of the game to begin with. \n\nNot even mentioning the SOUNDTRACK. This absolute banger of a soundtrack paired with super-intense-stimulus-overloading fights makes for some of the most fun you'll ever have in a hack n' slash game. Of course there are pretty easy to point out flaws with it like the story not being as long or good as the original, but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad for this game.

[/u]\n\nHowever, its existence on PC is a harder sell as the game's story is a continuation from the PS3/PS4  game Persona 5. Yes, you can just pick up and play Strikers, but unless you watched the anime, or played the prior game you won't know the characters, their backstory and all of their character nuances and personality traits.\n\n[b]So what is the game?[/b]\n\nIt's a story driven action game with RPG elements. As you play the game you're tasked with infiltrating 'Prisons'. You fight your way through until you defeat the boss at the end. As you progress you collect Personas. Think of these like Pokemon. Each Persona has different skills and abilities. Some heal, some buff or debuff and some do fire, wind or death magic. You level up your characters and persona to increase their power and learn new abilities.\n\n[b]The Good.[/b]\n\n[u]The voice acting. [/u]\n\nThe game isn't 'fully' voice acted. Some sections simply have to be read, however similar to the game this is based on, large sections of the game are fully voice acted and the quality of the voice acting really elevates the game. All of the voice actors from Persona 5 have reprised their roles, with the addition of Nolan North joining the cast as the detective Zenkichi.\n\n[u]The combat. [/u]\n\nThis isn't your typical musou game. Rarely is the screen filled to the brim with enemies. Instead, as you traverse the area, you will see enemies roaming around. You can choose to avoid them or 'ambush' them for a tactical advantage. Combat then starts with a small group of enemies to defeat. The combat is fast and satisfying, blending in a range of melee combos, ranged weapon attacks and abilities (think spells). Enemies often have weaknesses that can be exploited, leading to the opportunity to deal massive damage.\n\n[u]Music.[/u]\n\nThis is obviously a personal preference. I like the Persona 5 music a lot. The Striker's soundtrack builds upon the existing soundtrack making slight changes, such as heavier guitar riffs.  The only glaring example here is the first 'prison' stage. The music is a stark contrast to the rest of the game. It's akin to something you might hear on a pachinko or slot machine. It's loud, noisy and is particularly grating on the ears. \n\nMy personal preference is to use the DLC which allows you to use combat music from all of the previous Persona games. As a fan of the Persona series, I'll always choose to engage in combat with Mass Destruction playing.\n\n[b]The Ok.[/b]\n\n[u]Story.[/u]\n\nThe story of the game is in a weird place. Persona 5 Strikers is the story sequel to Persona 5, but not Persona 5 Royal. That means that none of the events of P5R have taken place. Not game breaking, but something to consider. The story itself is fine, if not a little predictable. It's welcome that the characters continue to develop past the P5 story. Hearing Haru refer to herself as 'Beauty Thief' again was welcome.\n\n[u]Fighting when?[/u]\n\nPersona 5 has a lot of story. Some of it is voice acted but a majority of it is reading conversations between The Phantom Thieves. Sometimes you just want to get back into the action, but you'll need to wade through the story elements first. I personally liked the story, but some people might not expect this much from a fighting game. Be warned.\n\n[b]The Ugly.[/b]\n\n[u]Eternal Bonds.[/u]\n\nMy only real criticism of the game came from my desire to 100% it. In particular, one Achievement stands out as egregious, and that is \"Eternal Bonds'. To get this achievement, you need to raise your Bond level in game to 99. Raising your bond level happens as you play the game. Major story events, killing rare bounties and defeating bosses will all net you some bond level. However, I completed the game around the 48 hour mark. I then started new game plus and played through it again. Even after two complete playthroughs, I still didn't have enough. \nI grinded one particular rare bounty for about 10 more hours. In hindsight, I could have played NG+ on the hardest difficulty, but I did so up until completing Alice's Palace, but the progress on the bond levels didn't seem any faster.\nSo there's a reason only ~3% of all players have completed all of the Achievements. It's due to Eternal Bonds. If you plan on grinding bond levels, be prepared to do a lot of this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0x5VNsTkQ \n\nIn the end, I did 100% Persona 5 Strikers. It's one of the few games I've sought to do so with. I still maintain it's the best game I have played all year and I do recommend it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f107ec6ffaf51c993b43a871d2e29b1", "author": "37f0883ea3be564689bd6770d9270139", "date": "2021-07-04", "hours": 232, "content": "You wanted persona 5 on steam and got the sequel before the base game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "144e624204ea5934a0c86ff5e9375305", "author": "1e30b6acb39759d7bfa4a91f85aab113", "date": "2021-07-04", "hours": 3981, "content": "great game with a great post game as well which is unusual for any persona game. its basically a warriors game with persona elements which is a lot of fun with the combat forcing you to either pick a general use persona or a persona that has a specific element that can counter the shadows you fight. it should be mentioned that you can control your team members and a lot of times they can handle the fight themselves since they all have excellent movesets.\n\nbiggest problem i have with this game is the persona fusion system. the persona fusion was way more in depth in the normal games than compared to this one as a majority of fusions are dependent on the level of the persona and really the arcana (especially in late game). its pretty annoying to grind PP to level up your late game persona.

There are 4 difficulties; easy, normal, hard, and merciless, which is only available in NG+. Personally, I played on hard mode up until the Osaka jail, because by then, it took me around 30 minutes or so to clear out certain prison keeps. Normal is a good difficulty for people who are possibly new to the action format (such as myself) and I have not tried easy, but given that its easier than normal, its most likely forgiving. The aspects of normal Persona mixed with action style gameplay is interesting, but in my experience, it is very rinse and repeat. Honestly, I couldn't do too many of the special moves or master arts, because enemies always hit me down before I could finish them. It was much easier to charge Joker's gun, or just spam whatever the enemy was weak to. As for the requests and jails, it's a mixed bag for me. The requests are decent, and dont take much time to complete, but that's about it. The jails are interesting, but unlike Persona 5, they don't offer many hiding spaces for ambushes, causing you to have to either be ambushed, shoot an enemy from far away, or attempt a direct hit. However, they are more action packed in my opinion. Using the environment to do phantom dash attacks are quite nice and can create cool combos if you can use them correctly. All in all, the gameplay isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either. My biggest complaints are that A. you can only see the telegraph for an enemy's attack if you are facing them, and B. you MUST be locked on if you want to quickly use a magic attack and keep the flow of your fight. I would, however, definitely play this over almost any triple A game made today.\n\nAs for the story, it essentially follows that of Persona 5. As a direct sequel (or spinoff? Royal makes things weird.), it takes place after the collapse of the Metaverse and after the Antisocial Force's semi-disbandment. Personally, I think that Strikers has a few loopholes that I won't go too deep into, but it does have some \"aha\" moments, but also some poorly instigated moments that just feel like a plot device. The story is still alluring, and I was invested the whole time, but some parts could have been a little fleshed out. The interactions between the Thieves were nice, however, which is one of the main things I like in Persona games.\n\nThe last part I'll probably talk about is formatting, graphics, ect. Frame cap is 60 fps which isnt the end of the world, but I did notice that Yusuke's showtime did lag out my computer occasionally, and sometimes when the camera pans out to a birds eye view or a showcase of the palace, there were glitched out portions of the screen, but that wasn't anything too bad. Nothing compared to the infinite loading screen I got on my rematch of the final boss :( But regardless, the game looks nice, obviously similar to that of the original Persona 5. The menus are nice, and the game has a lot of color.\n\nAll in all, I would still say this game is one of if not my favorite games on Steam, and for good reason. Every game has its flaws, but the world of Persona will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nPlus the music, too. Just buy the bonus content and listen to Counterstrike forever.

I also love Warriors games but here I can't get that almost immortal superhero 1 vs 1000 feeling as I have to dodge around and make fights as easy as possible with ambush tactics. Until the game throws me a boss or a mini boss with multiple times the difficulty I've had for the last 2 hours or so.\n\nI really wanted to like this game as it combines two of my favourites, but I can't really enjoy either side of it as is.

From what I played, there's no real spoilers from Royal I think but there could be secrets that I don't know about.  So playing royal isn't necessary but probably gives some extra flavor with some interactions more than likely. \nNow you might be asking yourself\n\n [i] Why do I need to play or watch Persona 5? [/i]\n\n well my good sir, ma'am or whatever pronouns align yourself with, this game is essentially more Persona 5 with a side of dynasty warriors game-play instead of that classic turn-base Persona Flavor. [b] If you haven't played or watched Persona 5 this game will not be that entertaining for you! You'll be buying a game that's basically an extra chapter to the Persona 5 story. If you have done so then the bold section does not pertain to you. [/b] Continuing on, You're not about to get all of the social simulator mechanics that Persona is known for but you'll be getting the aesthetic, music, and main cast interactions from it. If you want more of that this game is for you as this game is filled to the brim with fan-service but not the NSFW variety SO BACK TO TWITTER YOU GO YOU FIENDS, but I'll be joining y'all later.\n\nNow the for the main game-play...\n\nIts not for everyone.\n\nThe Dynasty Warriors formula is not the most responsive game-play of the bunch. At times you'll swatting away at a boss with long health bars for minutes on end. Luckily, they spiced things up by adding some SMT (Shin Megami Tensei a.k.a the series Persona derives from) mechanics which allows you to exploit the bosses weakness to beat them but that also go both ways. If you choose the wrong party for a fight some of your party members will get erased from the surface of the earth but if you already played Persona you'll be used to it. You can still customize your party to whatever play-style that suits you so if you want your Ryuji to be a physical Damage Chad you can do so. In particular with the game-play, I don't like the dodge function in this game, it took me while to understand it but I feel they could done of a better job at implementing it so you can dodge attacks more properly. Despite this though, defeating massive waves of shadows can be therapeutic but as I mentioned its just not for everyone.\n\nUltimately I think you should watch some game-play for a final verdict, Seeing is better than reading and if you see what I'm talking about you might be hooked or save some money in your bank account. If you're missing some Persona though this game is absolute must-buy specially if it get on sale for a better price.\n\nP.S\n\nWith the PC version the game was buggy in the past but since then I believe they patched \n certain things up so if you see any reviews about it being buggy make sure you check the date as the game could of been patched since then or there still could be issues with it. My experience wasn't too bad, I do admit to have issues in the beginning when the game first came out but after a month everything was smooth sailing to the end.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 65, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0c9ef609fab45c4ab43e4ebb1efd87bb", "author": "b0c93e0d4b0f55428b5f290dffb3790e", "date": "2021-06-25", "hours": 3497, "content": "Overall is a pretty good musou.

If you have some stronger gpu put the resolution on 4k because the game either has dogshit or no antialiasing at all.\n\nStory. Its a persona game, Also play the original Persona 5 before this, because its gonna spoil a shit ton for you, and you also wont know who is who and why is what happening.\n\nOnly thing i kind of didnt like about it, is the forced \"Fuse by Result\" fusion option from other games, and that to fuse some higher level personas you had to level some level 15 persona to 65, good you can boost them with ingame money(which is the only actual way to level them up because the xp they are getting is miserable).\n\nOverall i rate this game 10/10 a perfect sequel, i dont regret spending 60 euro on this.\n\n\ntips:  If you get stuck on the first bicorn miniboss because he oneshots you, its ok, just try killing him until you do it, and then you can continue enjoying the rest of the game. The goat is busted as fuck, he \u00eds like 2 times harder than any other miniboss, or maybe even as hard as an actual boss.\n        If you bought the old songs dlc, go to settings>game settings and scroll until you see what soundtrack you want to listen to. Select random. If you dont like some of the songs in there, you can turn them off.\n        After you defeat the final boss and watch the credits, your save will say the game is completed, but it really isnt. Load it, and you will get called to the velvet room where lavenza tells you to kill all the bosses again, and when you kill them, you will get a request for killing The Reaper, if you do that, you will get an achievement, and will be able to play ng++\n       You will transfer everything, except for some story items to new game plus, including your level money and compendium, so if you finish the first playthrough at level 80, you will get level 90 and fuse lucifer in no time.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09bda58028675ff59521c38e3739d381", "author": "08c9e42f60e85d249ba71397fce49a61", "date": "2021-06-23", "hours": 6222, "content": "One of the best jrpgs ive ever played, blew away my expectations very much, for a spin off i expected a lackluster story, ok gameplay, and forgettable characters, but i was very wrong, this game is extremely fun, the story is nearly as good as persona 5s, and the new characters all are very fleshed out and seem like they belong, if liked persona 5 you will almost definitely like this", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "af5422916e6050cfbdc57463e23b0fbb", "author": "66d0eba2f0ff5ba9910fcd7defd6cb0b", "date": "2021-06-22", "hours": 38, "content": "Played persona 5 and it was good, so this is good.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5931b0c7222454a297d1c4c185d5c1b9", "author": "f4dd2be309cc5217be18e486b9eac8d5", "date": "2021-06-22", "hours": 751, "content": "Cool game, but there are things here which I do not like in the slightest, like the overall level design (im on world 2 right now).

Highly recommended it to players who enjoyed P5's characters and themes.

Persona 4 Golden is a much better option,\n\nI found the gameplay to be rather enjoyable and thought it had a surprising amount of depth. The hack & slash setting and Persona based combat blended together rather well. There is however, no real social sim aspect and there is no confidant system. That being said, the character development for almost every character is really impressive. The new characters are also very well done. As usual, the OST is an absolute banger.\n\nCombat can get repetitive, and there are a few quality of life changes (accepting requests outside of the RV for instance) that would really help the experience. Persona fusion is also drastically simplified. There are only roughly 60 personas and fusing some of the last few takes a lot of grinding.\n\nOverall, if you liked P5 and are ok with a new combat system, this is a must have.

It is hard to argue the game is totally terrible, but I spent 80+ hours on it.  However, I do want to point out some fatal issues with this game which lead to my decision. First, the plot is filled with cliche. The story is highly predictable and boring. Second, personas play an awkward role in the combating system: on the one hand, creating/upgrading personas is so complicated, but personas are not necessary for non-merciless fights. So, it seems that there is a complicated system of personas that you would feel that it must mean something, but it actually does not really make much change until you play the merciless mode. On the other hand, once you play the merciless mode, the fight is unnecessarily hard and tedious without the proper personas, yet, the right personas basically make fights as a cycle of releasing persona skills, refilling sp and releasing skills again. I found myself push the same 3-4 buttons in the same order for 5 minutes to complete a boss fight in the merciless mode, which is boring. The creator failed to strike a balance between non-merciless game and the merciless game as well as the fight with and without strong personas. As an action game, fighting is one of the most important elements, failing to deliver challenging yet enjoyable fights makes the greatest failure of this game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 18, "funny": 3, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cfa6911fba7752f790b2f2e83d8bd3ab", "author": "471b40c1463d55ce8ab7189b562d356a", "date": "2021-06-18", "hours": 2809, "content": "Despite its flaws, honestly a pretty good sequel/spin-off to Persona 5. Probably one of the best spin-offs we'll get of a persona game, it's just pretty solid all around.\n\nThe cast of characters from the original game are just as enjoyable as they were before, and I really like the new additions of Zenkichi and Sophia, they're pretty great as well. Especially Zenkichi, he's probably one of my favourite Persona characters now. \n\nMusic is amazing as usual in this franchise, all of the battle themes are bangers, even the music in some of the cities are really great to listen to as well. \n\nGameplay is where I think I had a few problems with, as well as the story. The combat whilst being fun at times, I felt like could of been improved slightly or perhaps just not as repetitive as it was. Whilst I liked the action combat this time around instead of the turn based system in the original game, the novelty of it got old quick for me at least, and I didn't really enjoy it towards the later parts of the game. It's not bad, I just think it could be improved slightly (even if I'm not really sure how? I felt like sometimes the combat was just spammable sometimes with certain moves, or doing different combos weren't really rewarding). I still think how they implemented Personas in the combat was still pretty well executed though, but perhaps could of reduced some of the SP drain, as I felt that sometimes was pretty hard to manage at times. \n\nThe jail designs were pretty cool, but most of the time, I didn't really think too much of them as level designs. They weren't bad or anything, just nothing really memorable. \n\nThe story, even though I enjoyed most of it, felt formulaic and VERY similar to the original's. It's not bad, but perhaps slightly unoriginal and predictable times. Still felt it was interesting to go through though, and was definitely better than what I was expecting. \n\nOverall, I personally really enjoyed P5S despite its flaws. Honestly a pretty good spinoff to Persona 5, and you HAVE to have played the original to enjoy the game in my opinion, as it'll spoil you quite a bit of what happened in the original, and you'll miss some of the references. If you didn't like the original Persona 5, then I can't really recommend this game to you.

I love the focus on slice-of-life melodrama and cheese mixed with 'friendship is the true power!' anime goodness. The music is always god-tier, and the cast of characters are almost always endearing beyond easy comparison in the genre. \n\nTo say Persona 5 was a disappointment isn't exactly fair, but there were plenty of areas it fell short in, not just in relation to its predecessors, but entirely within its own goals, that I still talk about with my partner to this day. While its invention of an entire district called 'Shibuya' was no doubt innovative for the medium, spawning many spinoffs such as The World Ends With You or even a widespread effort in 1990's Tokyo to more closely mimic the buildings seen here, unfortunately that same inspiration couldn't be seen in the pacing and intricacies of its narrative. To go into greater detail here would be straying closer to writing a review of Persona 5 rather than Strikers, but I'll simply say that as the credits rolled on 5, I was filled with no great desire to ever see the Phantom Thieves again. \n\nThen Strikers came along and- I wish I could come up with a better phrase- stole my heart.\n\nStrikers' abandonment of the Social Link and time management systems that dominate the mainline Persona entries was publicized well beforehand, which caused me to be much more reticent about picking up the game. Would plot be taking a backseat? Would these already thin characters be reduced to little more than an aesthetic for Musou combat? \n\nIf those same worries assail you, please believe me when I say nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves flourish under a much sharper and much more tightly-written story here than in their own debut. While nothing deeply shellshocking for the genre, the plot has plenty of emotional gravitas, culminating not just in these pre-established heroes. but in practically every new addition to the cast. People act like human beings here, not 'shitty adults' or plot automatons. The core party has chemistry and plays off of each other brilliantly, and are even given actual time to enjoy themselves and more fully indulge their personalities beyond the most surface-level of jokes based on their eccentricities. \n\nThis story works in tandem with an absolutely phenomenal combat system. I've only had a very slim amount of experience with Musou games in the past, so I can't draw many comparisons, but I will say that simply getting through by button mashing is an impossibility. If you want to get through specific minibosses or even regular enemy encounters past the first few hours, you have to apply constant thought to your actions, thinking a few steps ahead, just like in JRPGs, while also honing your instincts and committing combos to muscle memory. It's an extraordinarily well-done fusion of genres that I very sincerely consider to rival the best in the business. Neither the turn-based roots nor the slasher reworks overshadow each other; instead, they compliment each other like sunlight illuminating a pane of stained glass, revealing how each individual facet constitutes a brilliant whole. \n\nI absolutely adore Strikers, and would argue it as better as most of the other games in its series, mainline, or spinoff. It understands its heroes' motivations better than the original game's writers, presents a beautifully innovative combat system, and strings along a truly magnificent score to lend each and every moment even greater impact. It's a masterwork of a title, and definitely the best game I've played so far this year.\n\nWell worth every last penny, and so many more.\n\nThese devs deserve a raise.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "073fe920cc6e51a1886b2a10ff2ab03b", "author": "953202f2d8cd50699a0662d822f3aab2", "date": "2021-06-16", "hours": 7364, "content": "I pre-bought this game, so I was really hyped for it.\nMaking this review because I forgot to do it when i ended it.\npretty poggers game ngl, morgana is still alive and simping so it's really enjoyable", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eca953786af0503fbfef73cd174cd684", "author": "7607e661569f5e9c9735f98537732f8b", "date": "2021-06-15", "hours": 3035, "content": "music slaps and you get a van.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ab0bfd261aff5137bc1c2dc640c3b852", "author": "cdf19dd1507655c49f9ace7f8bc8195f", "date": "2021-06-15", "hours": 604, "content": "I did not know I could experience an overdose of coolness until I played that game.

The characters maintain their growth and prove how memorable they are through dialogue, the story is a heartwarming romp across Japan, and the music keeps the funky flair mixed with newfound upbeat tempos and hard rock to hammer home the extremely hype show-stopping moments of the game. With a run time of 90-100 hours and then some for those who want even more, the price is well worth it if you are looking for a new action game to sink your free time into.\n\nHowever, the combination of classic Persona mechanics and action game speed, timing, and reflexes, along with some new innovations or streamlined bits, creates a super cool blend of worthwhile progression that is as addicting as it is semi-frustrating. You can only get better at the game by practicing your moments of striking while the iron is hot, but when ambushes effectively end encounters before they begin when the Phantom Thieves gain higher levels, sometimes there are points when you are just waiting to put your button skill and game knowledge to a real test. It is a minor grievance, but admittedly this was an issue on normal difficulty for me. I plan on trying out harder difficulties in the near future.\n\nOverall, this is a must have for Persona 5 fans, possibly Persona/Shin Megami Tensei fans in general who want an electrifying change of pace from the turn-based format that you're used to.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "515abf1d8fa2527dbfe4f96ffdafab60", "author": "15b2829a8d725a88b22e138a5fd90b6e", "date": "2021-06-14", "hours": 774, "content": "It's fun hack and slash, and a good sequel to persona 5 but i wish persona 5 royal gets ported", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "12e9913ae15157c39018aa8af698da66", "author": "50de4dc9b9dd512d8c6a1abe442675bb", "date": "2021-06-14", "hours": 1598, "content": "I like the play style and how it differs from the original game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "02ab75d9a595547b97affae18cd55325", "author": "3002701e13ba5332bc39e8dc2b4cb0d5", "date": "2021-06-14", "hours": 2492, "content": "u can beat up japanese tony stark in a mech suit with cool music so good game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fc1fc046784b5639b2a77c1c51aaef6f", "author": "660f58ba8fe755ca9de126dcafb1049a", "date": "2021-06-13", "hours": 5249, "content": "8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan)\nPersona 5 Strikers is by definition, A Sequel to Persona 5 (not royal, as it does not seem to have references to that game story wise), and its a damn good one at that. Even though the game was not only using a completely different Fighting system, from Turn based to Warriors Hack and Slash like, AND was made by a different company, the game at large still feels and plays like a Persona game. What Koei Tecmo pulled off to recreate the Persona style is nothing but extraordinary. Many of their previous warriors games, in my opinion, were just plain boring. I am not a big fan of Warriors games, but somehow they made Persona 5 Strikers still feel not only like Persona, but an actual fun game (sorry Warriors fans). Now onto the pros and cons of this game.\n\nCombat: The combat in this game is simply amazing, especially for a combat system that I previously dislike. With the use of not only Personas and the Phantom Dash Mechanic making the combat feel unique and special each interaction, but also each character's unique playstyle and personality, while also staying true to who they are from the previous game. The game always tries to throw in a new gimmick or mechanic into the fight each time you progress in order to prevent the combat from becoming stale. Fighting large quantities imo is just plain satisfying, however fighting one, strong enemy can show the limits of the combat system. The game does try to spice it up with new mechanics, but it is obvious the combat was made for large groups, as slashing only one target doesn't feel as satisfying, and there were a couple of moments where I thought turn based would had made the boss fight more interesting.\n\nDifficulty: the game was simply easy, a bit too easy at times but at the same time, would be hard. It may be due to me doing all the requests in the game, but near the end it was very uncommon to die, as the game had many many, many forgivable mechanics in order to prevent death, while also many of the enemies would telegraph their attack, allowing for alot of time to react and dodge. There was a Merciless option too, but that was only after you beat the game + post-game content.\n\nStory:Im not going to dive deep into the story simply to avoid spoilers, but at large, the story was pretty damn good. Again, wasn't as good as mainline Persona games, but was still really good at the end and gave me the badass feel that the Persona 5 story previously gave me. The message of this game was also pretty good, tackling modern society issues, and having really complex characters, with none of them being just pure good or pure evil, but instead having reasons for their actions.\n\nCharacters: the Phantom Thieves has returned yet again, and I think they still were just as good as in the previous game. They even gave Haru much needed character development that persona 5 lacked in, while also making everyone else more fleshed out, while sticking to who they were in the first game. The New Characters were also amazing, as not only were the new main characters super fleshed out, but also the side characters and the antagonists were really amazing to watch and learn about. There wasn't really an amazing main antagonist like what persona 4 and kinda persona 5 had, but the story kinda went through the same story arc as persona 5 did, and tbh I was fine with it.\n\nMusic: as always, the Persona music is back and better then ever. The OST for this game consisted of mostly remixes of previous Persona 5 music, usually in a rock remix format. There was also brand new music for this game, and they were simply sooooooo goooooodddd. Idk how tf they produce bangers after bangers of music, but they do somehow. There was an issue for the ratio of new music and remix music, as I did feel like there was a bit too many remixes where they could had used a new song, but the remix were bangers anyways so I ain't complaining lol.\n\nSmall Nitpicks/Positives:\n-LOVED how this game felt like Persona 5: Sequel, with just a new combat system.\n-PC controls were awful, I had to remap a shit ton of buttons in order to make it playable. In the end I got it to work and made if playable, but there was still some issues I couldn't get rid of like how the camera was just either too damn fast, or too damn slow to rotate. I know the game was made for controllers, but whatever I am just that kind of guy.\n-The Voice mixing in this game was all around the place. Most of the time, it was pretty good. Sometimes however, the Voice actor would be too quiet, too loud or even have a drop in quality as if they didn't have any noise suppression. It was especially obvious during the beginning segments, like how sometimes even the character's audio would be so damn quiet I would have to repeat them, which just sucked. It was however pretty obvious it was due to the Voice actors having to record remotely due to Covid-19, so I think they get a pass in that regard.\n-from persona 5 to persona 5 strikers, due to the combat change, some things were nerfed or majorly buffed indirectly. The SP pool was still pretty small, that was just a 5 thing in the series and its back in strikers. However, items are just 10x better in this game due to not only having huge quantities to buy in the shop and around the city, but also due to now being able to pause the game and chug a shit ton of potions and food without the penalty of it taking a turn like what the previous persona games did. IMO I wasn't a big fan of this, as it did kinda slow down combat, but it was different due to the combat, and there wasn't much to do in that regard except maybe nerf the amount of items.\n-The game also had weird PC port things alongside it. Its obviously a console port of a game with things like 60 fps lock, game logic pauses when you don't focus on the window, till you go back into the game, and even with max details, the game seemed to have an anti-aliasing issue, with characters and further away objects just looking pretty pixelated imo.\n\nIn conclusion, the game was still really damn good, especially for a persona spinoff title. This is most def the best spinoff title from the entire persona series, but I still think the turn based combat should stick for the mainline series going down. Even though I really enjoyed this combat system, it did have its limitations, especially with large boss fights that the other system didn't lack. Of course large quantities was better in this system, but hey. Other than that, this game is especially worth to get if you played Persona 5, as this is just a continuation sequel to that game. If you are a first timer however the game is still really damn good, but you maybe lost in the story element and characters as you don't know who they are and what they did before, as they especially make tons of references to the previous game. I still think you can go thru this game w/o persona 5 experience, but I still highly recommend playing Persona 5 First. The length of the game took me around 50-55 hours, which also included me doing all the requests that was allowed in first playthrough, which is a really damn good length and so worth the price of the game (idk why people complained it was too explained like ok lol).\n\n8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan), really damn good game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ca67b2651916577f9f95ae8ea49c7b19", "author": "2131d19cfdd65db1ab1ea3442f7ed5ac", "date": "2021-06-13", "hours": 3777, "content": "Ryuji says very bad word. 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4d1d1856867c5d8988696058b9db56ad", "author": "6e6c23ed5531585ca8ec4c2cefe882c0", "date": "2021-06-13", "hours": 2850, "content": "A bit repetitive in terms of gameplay but it was fun to have another adventure with the Phantom Thieves again", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c3bf022aa0a5ae9b9c2d2a4579c1f3b", "author": "ae2d99f2697051a3b405a6c865f2e374", "date": "2021-06-13", "hours": 5271, "content": "Out of all the persona franchise games I've played, Strikers is probably my new favorite!

Just be warned that there is lots of button and mouse mashing ;-; The play style is also very different than what is characteristic for persona games which are typically turn based, but I actually really liked the style used in strikers, as it was more engaging and action packed. I will caution that the game covers some pretty heavy topics, but if you are a fellow persona or P5 lover this title is a must play.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d185a71858ba555aa6ca76e0baa394df", "author": "1ce8e2a8baff5ac78743e496c1e8eabd", "date": "2021-06-12", "hours": 2503, "content": "At the end of the day it's a Persona game so if you like the Persona series in terms of lore and story then you'll like it however for me the combat was abit clunky and difficult to get used to and for me i prefer the turn based aspect over p5 or royal than strikers hack and slash.

Strikers does not contain content from persona 5 (The) Royal such as new characters.\n\nPersona works like final fantasy in that each entry in the series is self contained but shares elements between all of them. Personas (The spirits/demons/manifestations you summon to help you fight) and other mechanics work similarly across the other games but the story can be understood and is grounded on an individual basis.\n \nPersona 5 in particular is inception meets anime and Persona 5 Strikers tosses the turn based combat system for a real time fighting game with a story centered on travel around Japan. Outside the dungeons you advance the story and prepare by obtaining items such as healing or buff single use items and equipment and accesories that affect stats and damage. In the dungeons you manage your energy to clear objectives advancing towards the goal of stopping people from hurting people, just like base game 5. \n\nYou have a nice full team with different fighting styles you can swap between but you're really gonna stick with the main character, Joker, due to having the most direct power progression and for him being the character who's perspective you'll experience most of the story from. As soon as the game gives you the chance I recommend just learning how everyone works. Exp sharing is on I think but people will still lag behind I think. You'll want everyone about the same power.\n\nPersona as a series knows how to use a great deal of subtlety, but it's main ideas it will remind you of often, and loudly. The great music being the best example (Im looking at you \"wake up, get up, get out there\" from 5!) The story is about many things but remember growth and understanding are at the center. It's very anime, trust the power of friendship. \n\nMy main enjoyment of the games' stories is that they help with introspection of ideas by having a wide range of approaches presented to you with many of their consequences and logical/emotional fallacies shown clearly.\n\nGameplay wise: Hit those weaknesses! Your auto combo does different stuff depending on which persona you have and each enemy has different weaknesses. Thanks to free abilities with certain persona combo attacks if you have the skill you could go entire boss fights not spending any energy- if you manage to survive that long and have the patience, otherwise press the persona button to pause the game and aim an ability. This uses SP which less items and abilities recuperate easily. Keep a wide variety of attacks available, fighting without hitting weaknesses gets expensive fast and every time you leave a dungeon to recuperate the enemies re-spawn.\n\nPersonal recommendation for a game mechanic I wish I knew about sooner, accumulated power: If you feel low power in the game fuse more personas towards your level cap. Don't be afraid if a persona becomes a lower level than the cap from a fusion, it will eventually get more stats the more you fuse the resulting persona. \nIf you do a newgame + run...check the guides.\nHaru best girl don't @ me.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "05b5eda9589f5e599cbbb4714020ce05", "author": "616e17d5cf53519a8d0915cf65e39d88", "date": "2021-06-06", "hours": 224, "content": "the music is fucking amazing", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f446649a0e205a7d8bd2ab0065c38517", "author": "1a07ac26bb51501b87c734067359d837", "date": "2021-06-05", "hours": 3819, "content": "A new take on the persona games that retains its values from said games that has a slow start but once the story picks up it becomes more enjoyable.

Now, I highly recommend you at the very least watch a playthrough of the original Persona 5 (Or Persona 5 Royal) first before picking this game up, as it's a direct sequel to Persona 5. I won't be covering the story of Strikers much in this review either.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5, you once again play as Joker, as you and the rest of the Phantom Thieves travel around Japan for the Summer. That's pretty much the premise.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from the mainline games, Persona 5 Strikers is a Hack and Slash with RPG elements. The gameplay itself I found quite fun, and I definitely found a few of the battles a bit challenging, even on normal difficulty. \n\nOne of my favorite parts gameplay-wise is that I never ever felt the need to grind for experience. I never felt too underleveled or too overleveled. The game also reintroduces Persona fusion. And while not as vast as the mainline games, it was still quite robust and intuitive. Dare i say, some aspects of the fusion I liked more compared to Persona 5. \n\nWithout getting into it, the story was really good, on-par with most persona games. I found myself invested in not only the characters i'm familiar with, but also the newly introduced ones. And there were a lot of moments that made me visibly happy, sad, angry, and so on. And that's a sign that they did something right.\n\nContent-wise, this game has quite a bit. It only took me roughly 40 hours to beat from start to finish over the course of four days, then again I played it practically nonstop when I bought it. I'm a bit of a Persona fanboy, haha. \n\nI do also plan on completing this game 100%, definitely. This game has quite a lot you can do in it, even in post-game you still got some stuff left.\n\nThe english voice acting was fantastic. I plan to play the game again in Japanese to compare, but I just LOVE the english voice cast so much, some of the deliveries were on point, and I laughed out loud quite a bit at many lines.\n\nOf course, I can't talk about a Persona game without addressing the best part about the series. The music.\n\nGood GOD the music. It's fantastic! The music is a LOT more fast paced compared to the mainline games. All the battle tracks get me absolutely hyped to fight. And the remixes of songs like Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert, among others, were done amazingly well! I could listen to each track for hours and NEVER get tired of it! \n\nI did yoink the deluxe edition though, which means I got two DLCs along with the base game! So I'll cover that next.\n\nThe first DLC was the all-out attack pack, it gives you a bunch of skill cards, along with 10,000 Persona points you can use to level personas up. The skills cards were nice, but also a bit unnecessary since the game is quite generous with it's skill cards, doesn't really justify the need for the price tag. \n\nThere's also the BGM DLC, it adds tracks from various persona mainline games. In my opinion, this is the better DLC option of the two. Changing the BGM can help change battles up a bit, and the fact that they remixed the battle theme from Revelations: Persona just for this game says a lot to me.\n\nThe Deluxe edition also came with bonus content on the side! Such as the soundtrack, a digital art book, and Behind-the-scenes footage! Which I find really cool! Watching the footage gives you a glimpse as to how much passion went into the game, and I enjoyed watching it!\n\nNow that all that's been said, let's get into the issues I had with this game, it's mainly bugs and small issues though.\n\nOne of the biggest things i experienced was audio issues, in-game audio was cutting in and out, along with crackling and stuttering. This is most apparent when I went to shop for things and bought things over and over in quick succession, or when I was in a menu like the compendium and scrolling down from the top to the bottom really quickly. This also happens in animated cutscenes, which kind of breaks the flow of everything, unfortunately. It never happened that often during normal gameplay, but it was often enough to the point that it ended up being really distracting, Although it was extremely rare, the game would also crash, which definitely was a bit frustrating when it did happen. A smaller thing was various instances of voiced dialogue not matching the text box, and lastly, audio balancing with the english voices. Sometimes the english voice acting is hard to understand, they sound too quiet, even had to turn the music down so i could hear the voice acting. This was mostly apparent with soft spoken voices. I'm not too mad at the audio balancing though, since they were recorded during a global pandemic, so that's something I can let go. That's pretty much it with my issues. \n\nAll in all, if you don't wanna deal with the audio issues and rare crashes, then I recommend getting the PS4 version, as it's probably the best version of the game.

Endgame often turns into a case of spamming persona attacks and SP items (the grind for SP items is real, especially since shops don't restock unless you do multiple battles in the metaverse)\nSome controls are a little wonky (such as all-out attack, phantom dash, follow-up attack, interact, etc. all being triggered by the same button, with limited ability to create separate hotkeys for them).

It takes what people loved about the characters and atmosphere of Persona 5 and made a sequel that was very enjoyable, but I will start with some problems I had. First off I can't really recommend this game to someone who hasn't experienced the story of Persona 5 in one way, shape, or form. The game does a good job of relating back to certain things in the plot for context, but you may not feel very connected if you don't know the content from before.  Secondly, the combat in the early game feels very repetitive, and not very satisfying. My friends who also played this game felt the same for some confirmation. You will need to start getting stronger and more versatile Personas before you start getting into the good stuff. This is an RPG so that's a given, so if you thought you could mash through the game it won't be that easy. Lastly, the story is kind of stale for the first chunk and feels like you're getting nowhere. Once the Phantom Thieves start piecing together the signs and make their way towards the bigger baddies, the story gets very good, very fast thankfully. This leads on to the good parts. The game looks fantastic on PC. The effects and landscapes pop with color and are a pleasure to look at. Also the mid-late game story is very good, along with the ending being very nice. An absolute plus is the post-game content. There are many requests you can do for stronger weapons and fighting harder version of previous bosses for a fun challenge. Though I had my issues I highly recommend this game to Persona fans, but give a smaller recommendation to new comers. Very fun, maybe wait for a price drop. 8/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f1e160c5783541c9da5453062ca77be", "author": "f4f69e4059a55ca0bd40188b69c58760", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 4548, "content": "I started playing this game immediately after obtaining the Platinum Trophy for P5R on the PS4. It felt weird at first, after 190+ hours of turn based combat on P5R. However, once you get used to the changes, P5S is a true successor of P5R. This is a true sequel, maybe not so big as the original, but everything is here: all the Phantom Thieves, all the adventures, amazing music, top quality voice cast and loads of fun and things to do. I hope this game receives the Royal treatment in the future.\n\nSuggestion: Play P5R first before playing this game. There are a lot (and I mean a lot) of references to P5R that make you connect more with the plot if you know what they mean.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that Ann completely forgot about being my GF xD", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3957ea011e735b029a290a26a90384d1", "author": "167450c9fb8f586c947f2d9b09048fd3", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 5203, "content": "Both the best Warriors game, and least warriors game.\n\nPersona strikers is a sequel to the vanilla persona 5 that plays with the hack and slash combat of dynasty warriors.\nstory wise this doesn't have any plot points related to persona 5 royal.\n\nquick questions:\n\nWhich version should you buy:\nEither buy the game one PC or PS4, don't bother with the switch version. PC and PS4 are so similar it just comes down to your preference, on switch, the loading times are like waiting at your local dmv to retake your license photo while the old man is yelling at the girl behind the counter on why he can't show an ID to confirm his states residency so you just have ti sit there until he finally leaves so you can get your picture done and move with your afternoon.\nIts bad.\n\ndo you need the deluxe edition?\nNo. Unless you intend on doing multiple playthroughs and need variety in the music, there isn't any point to it. the all out attack pack gives you some resources that'll make the early game easier at the start. but after that, you'll be swimming in resources, so really your just paying 10 extra bucks for legacy music.\n\ndo you need to play any other games prior to starting this?\nNot unless you want to. Play persona 5 or watch the anime, you won't be super lost here. the game tells its own story that takes place a few months after the events of persona 5, though your not going to be drowned in call backs and references to the previous game. Its got a few places it takes itself for a persona game thats a fun ride, least to say, you'll be entertained if you're in the camp who just loves persona for its story\n\nHow difficult is the game?\nPlaying on normal mode, its fairly simple and wont beat you to your knees after the first couple hours. you might feel starved for resources at first, but after the first dungeon is done, you'll be fine. Worst case, if you fight tougher enemies without their weaknesses in your party, the fights will just last another 15-ish minutes.\nOnce you go into new game plus however, your characters will die in only a couple hits. Its doable, though a clear difference.\n\nhow long is the game?\ndoing a single playthrough on normal mode with doing every side quest, and most achievments, just over 50 hours. For completionist 86-95 hours since you will have to grind a small amount near the end.\nI 100% the game 86 hours and didn't feel like I was grinding at all until the last 3 hours. By far this was one of the most enjoyable games I've 100% as the pacing really doesn't struggle to keep itself together.\n\nNow for everything else:\nHow different is this game from normal dynasty warriors & persona?\nbesides throwing out turn based combat and the traditional calendar system, your able to freely come and go from the games dungeons as much as you want at no penalty to you.\nYou wont need to manage keeps and battle enemies in hordes and dictate who should target what, rather you have a set map you can be stealthy and fight enemies in with your 4 party members (who can be switched with the entire cast outside of battles ) will join the fight. killed a handful of enemies and move on. \"Keeps\" from dynasty warriors have been reduced to simply plot points on the map rather than a part of the map to take that you dont wanna lose.\nthere's a clear simplicity from the usual warriors spin off here and its all the better for it.\nPersona fusing is here again as you'll be getting sacrificing personas to keep yourself going.\nall the party members are useful this time around and you'll use them all fairly regularly through the main the main story.\n\nfinal verdict: 10/10\nTLDR: a solid hack and slash that doesn't feel like tedious, even into the games final moments of completion.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 36, "funny": 5, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "17ab8ed8c19e5a1796d2eb22fa0a60da", "author": "812d961e1a455a4592726aaddb122521", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 645, "content": "You'll never see it coming", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ac73fe573ba45d1e94ad8617c19dfefa", "author": "403c492dc1825adb8e3be7c57efa40a4", "date": "2021-05-23", "hours": 1834, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the Vanilla Persona 5 (PS3/PS4) game NOT Royal. With that being said, to enjoy the full experience of Strikers. The player must've played/experienced the Vanilla Persona 5, since there's a lot of inside jokes from that game. \n\nThis time around, Strikers is a Hack&Slash with some JRPG mechanics. Due note that there's no S-Links, no romance/dating options, and there's a lot of cutscenes. What makes Strikers unique from the other Warriors games is that it requires a lot more strategy. Meaning early game the player can't just spam magic attacks - which requires SP (Skill Points) to win every battle. Remember this is an Atlus game, they make their games difficult in the beginning to make sure the player understand the game's mechanics. \n\nJust like the other Persona games, there is a calander system.... eh kinda. While there are events in the game, Strikers is a very story heavy game. Even if the player exits a dungeon, no time/day will pass. Days only progress when the story progresses, so no need to worry about deadlines. There are some Social events that play out and trust me you'll want to get these events. Bonds are what replaced the S-Links, but these serve to improve/upgrade combat and gameplay. \n\nOverall, my experience with Persona 5 Strikers was a great one. I've 100% completed this game 3x (PS4, Switch, and pretty soon Steam). I will say there's an achievement called \"Eternal Bonds\" that takes forever to complete. Even though my playtime shows 30 hours, the game itself is about 45-50 hours (I skipped the cutscenes on steam, but not on PS4) its a lot of content for those who enjoy anime and/or Persona mainline games. I'd highly recommend it.

They just don't do anything for me, but P5S managed to keep me engaged enough that I didn't really care what kind of combat I was dealing with. The battles were a bit more than just mashing the square button and had some variation based off yours and the enemy Personas which was nice. I think my biggest complaint is that the EXP share isn't a flat rate so you're forced to change out party members every 15 minutes if you want them to stay roughly the same level (which you do need to do).\nI could go on and on about the combat, but likely if you're buying the game, you're more here for the characters and setting. \n\nIt was great to have the gang back together (minus Kasumi and Akechi), and overall the plot was really enjoyable. Another thing this game did great was the setting. I thought I would be super bummed not being able to run around Tokyo but all the new locations were super detailed and interesting. I also have to say all the new characters are fantastic. I only wish I got to see Zenkichi and Akechi bounce banter off of each other.\nThere was also some more character development. Nothing ground-breaking but they did give it to characters who could've used an extra couple of minutes in the spotlight (ex. Haru)\n\nAll the new music was great. Obviously a lot of what you hear is recycled from P5 but that is no big deal since P5 has arguably one of the greatest OSTs of all time.\n\n\nDon't expect to drop another 150 hours into the game like you did with the original P5 or P5R as there's just not that much side content, and story isn't nearly as long.\nThe game will net you about 45 to 60 hours depending on if you care about being a completionist.\nOverall 8.7/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5b82195ca70f5969a2aed5753208d3f2", "author": "b74d44e641135e038608c379480ca37d", "date": "2021-05-17", "hours": 413, "content": "solid experience, though I can get why some people may not like Warrior styled games, this one does take some extra moves from the Persona series to make it more unique and less brainless", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fdf30cf5ef0558db810acc8bce8043b6", "author": "0cc95b20036258798eee75abe06b4773", "date": "2021-05-16", "hours": 2135, "content": "Forgot to write a review when I finished it and am now coming back months later to do so.

I Really did not like persona 5, neither it's main story or it's characters. All the problems I had with 5 are pretty much absent here. They don't gripe about adults every 5 minutes, they don't complain about society every 2 minutes and they also don't talk about how much better they are than everybody every second. I don't know if this game is great or if my low expectations after P5 make it seem great, but I do know that I want the combat and the writers back for Persona 6. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nUnlike P5, this game has active real-time combat as opposed to turn based combat. P5 tried to ad flair and look cool but it fell flat because the characters ended up just standing still and taking turns in combat. The sense of progression and picking the right persona for the job is still here, but with combat that seems to fit the story better. You have basic attacks. You have special persona attacks you can weave in with the basic attacks, and you have your normal persona abilities you know from the mainline series separate from that. This is what persona 5 tried and failed to make you feel, strong and powerful in the face of an army. There are also no more punishments and subsequent incentives to finish a jail in one day. No more time management YAY :D Time management was my biggest gripe with P3-P5, but it's not here.\n\nSTORY:\nDo you want to go on a cross country summer tip with your friends? me too :,( This is just a group of friends doing exactly that, kinda. Saying it's a rehash of P5's story would be a disservice, but it really does feel like the writers saw the potential in it's story and rebuilt it from the ground up. No more cartoonishly evil villains. All of your \"enemies\" are all shown to have suffered greatly and as a result their desires have been twisted. In P5 they were \"twisted\" because the story demanded it. No more \"I know whats best for society\" main-characters. In P5 they were pretty much just like the main villain, but were never called out on it or made to think about it.\n [spoiler] The main \"villain\" this time is actually just the Phantom thieves, but on a much larger scale. He points out that they can't help everyone, that even now while they are talking people are suffering. He want's to become a hero for everyone, to help everyone the phantom thieves can't. His way of doing it is to basically brainwash people, and remove freedom entirely (just like the phantom thieves can be argued are doing to their targets) and when it is pointed out to him that he is basically erasing peoples humanity and becoming like the figure who traumatized him he relents. I am a bit sad that no one pointed out to him that he was punishing the innocent majority for crimes committed by the guilty minority, especially since there was a cop there, but compared to P5 it is flawless. [/spoiler] \nThe characters never stop interacting with each other, so it really does feel like a friends group out on a trip. P5 did little to make them actually seem like friends that would hang out outside of Phantom thieves business, and while this does little to remedy that, it does pair all of them off to some degree. So while they may not keep contact with everyone, they will at least keep in contact with someone. I can see Ryuji and Yuskuke, Futaba and Yusuke, Ryuji and Ann, Makoto and Haru. Just like a real friends group, some of them seem to hit it off better than others. This felt lacking in P5, but there were at least more contained single stories I suppose.\n\nMUSIC:\nYeah, it's pretty good. Some remixes from P5 to make them fit better with the real-time action combat. The jails all have personal BGM as you are walking around just like P5. The first jail has an absolute banger of a track, while the others do their job of building atmosphere well enough. The last one can be argued is alright. The battle music really gets the blood pumping and get you ready for a fight. It makes what happens on screen just feel that more sick. If you bought the battle tracks from the other persona games as well, then you get a good amount of music to make sure you never really tire of any one of them. \n\nFINAL RATING:\nStanding on it's own: ?/10\nCompared to P5: 11/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e6735c81a8935326830aa74c2fc8cc1d", "author": "33cd82cbc3e8596fb6514b9e3a19be6b", "date": "2021-05-15", "hours": 3629, "content": "I played a game about teenagers having fun and saving the world while I am in a dark room on my own and lonely......\n9/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8d868a1bcd985d1fb39a1657ed1b5475", "author": "82787d8c0aff5fc5aad6eaa5f564d0e3", "date": "2021-05-15", "hours": 1056, "content": "gives me nostalgia of my first time playing persona and i love this game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 15, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "862a130b2bc5577eba601bec4c6b4464", "author": "490214f6742d56e6956e7a750cbb8e6b", "date": "2021-05-15", "hours": 1793, "content": "Persona 5 strikers is a very fun and exciting journey into a more grounded style of persona gameplay.

Writing is expectedly weaker than the main game (as is with Persona spin offs), but the new characters and group interactions pretty much make up for it. I'm not afraid to say Zenkichi is one of the best Persona characters and he carried the whole game. Sorry, it's the truth.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay, back when this game was announced, a lot of people were expecting this to be another mindless button masher like a lot of the licensed Musou games are, but P5S is far from that. Battling enemies incorporates P5's dungeon exploration mechanics to present smaller (when compared to a normal musou) but still fast paced encounters between big numbers of enemies. The addition of elemental magic, buffs and debuffs from the turn based games grants the gameplay a new layer of depth and more ways to deal with enemies other than melee attacks. There is some grind, but it never feels like a chore because the combat is really addictive and super fun.\n\nAs for the rest of the game's elements: amazing soundtrack (as is to be expected from Meguro) and vibrant and stylish UI and overall presentation. My only complaint is that the antialiasing implementation is terrible and if you don't force it with external tools, the game will look blurry and ugly. The port had some serious issues when it came out but most of them seem to have been fixed with the latest patches.\n\nSo, all in all, this is an amazing game.

It is a sequel, so prior knowledge of Persona 5 is required to get the full experience. Of course, you could still play the game as is, but be warned that there are a few spoilers here and there so I would advise against it.\n\nGameplay wise, it is different from the traditional turn based style the Persona series is known for, that being Persona 5 Strikers is in a style of a musou game with Persona mechanics. This was my first musou game so it took a while of getting used to, but it was fun steamrolling through waves of enemies, and with Persona 5's flashy style and gameplay mechanics, made it a much more enjoyable experience. \n\nIn terms of story, I'd say it's pretty good although that could be my bias towards Persona 5 in general. I do think that if you enjoyed the prequel, you would enjoy this one as well. (I don't really want to say much as I can't really explain without spoilers, sorry.)\n\nLast of all, I want to talk about the PC port. For me, it ran perfectly fine for the most part, but it could be by many factors such as with the new patch (1.02), my hardware, and etc. \n\nFor those who want to know what my hardware I'm using, I'm using a Ryzen 5 2600 and a RX 580.\nThe GPU driver version that I'm using is 20.4.2.\n\nThroughout my playthrough the game only crashed 1 or 3 times but they were at minor parts (like an event with hanging out with Ryuji and Ann near the beginning of the game) so I'm glad it was mostly fine for me and I hope your experience goes smoothly. My computer also didn't suffer from the \"infinite black screen\" bug in the 5th Jail. I would advise to save whenever you can, just to be safe and to keep submitting your game issues to Atlus so that they could look into it and hopefully bring out another hotfix if you are still experiencing issues.\n\nOverall, this is a great sequel to an already great game, and I would definitely say give it a shot if you liked Persona 5 but wanted more content. \n\nWith the success of sales with this game, I hope Atlus and SEGA can continue to bring more of their games on to PC and multiple platforms. I personally do not see the point of having third party game exclusives as bringing games to multiple platforms will not only would bring in more sales, but it can introduce many people to their franchises, and it can make them more popular than they are now.\n\n:D", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "62e140973d885bac91081d0b3edf7606", "author": "61e3d53568f75bc68306ea82bba8a4ee", "date": "2021-05-12", "hours": 5330, "content": "if you like persona franchise this game is for you. \"Hack and slash\" gives this game fresh feeling than the usual turn based game.

The original game was a turn based rpg but this is a action game with rpg elements.  Think Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy 7 Remake.  Strikers is an actual sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not even Royal but the original Persona 5).  Also the original game is still only available on PS4 so if you don't have a PS4 and want to experience all the story before this point you are going to be shit out of luck.\n\nAll this weird shit out of the way, the game is pretty dang good.  Gameplay is fast and tactical. Lots of fun combos and can weave in persona abilities in-between them.  The music features some original compositions as well as tracks ripped straight from P5. The remixed battle themes are probably the biggest highlights here.  Story is entertaining but can feel a bit too familiar if you already have played Persona 5 before (even the characters will say, \"Hey didn't we do something like this before?\")  The new characters for the most part are pretty well written and interesting.   Voice acting is great.\n\nNow for my complaints.  This game can feel a bit too long especially with the story being predictable.  This isn't necessarily a complaint but I felt like more risks could have been taken here.  I also feel like there is not a huge variety of personas compared to all the other games.  There are a lot of cool ones here but it feels lacking.  A lot of the side quests are also pretty bland and lack creativity.  Kill X guys with X character repeat x50.  \n\nSo yeah, game is fun.  Kind of a hard recommend if you haven't already played Persona 5 as you will be in the dark in quite a lot of details especially character relationships and words like \"Metaverse\" or \"Palace.\"  I would definitely recommend if you already played Persona 5 and are open to action rpg games.  7.5/10\n\nAlso Atlus just put P5 on steam already.

It was a really amazing ride and took me around 50 hours to beat. \nAnd well I'll be listing some pros and cons as well as some personal \"feelings\" down the end. Keep in mind, I'll only list the really important parts in this review. SPOILER FREE REVIEW! \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[b] * Good story [/b]\nThe story in this game is pretty damn good and works perfectly as a sequel. \nThe Phantom Thieves reunite again to steal the hearts and desires of even more adults on a \"roadtrip.\" That's about what I can say without spoilers. \n\n[b] * The gameplay and 60fps! [/b]\nUnlike all the other Persona games, this one isn't turnbased. It's a hack and slash type of game, but it does it kinda differently. You'll still have to hit the enemies' weaknesses to do more damage and stun them, meaning you still have to think, it'll just be a bit more action-paced. And the combat is also really satisfying. Oh. Did I mention that this game is actually in 60fps? No 30fps cap. \n\n[b] * Visuals and cutscenes look better than they've ever been! [/b]\n[b] * The level design [/b]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] * The repetitive story. [/b]\nThis story is really good! But! This Persona game does like every other Persona game, it keeps the same formular in the story. For example, in Persona 5/Royal you go and infiltrate palaces, but most of the palaces are made for you to get another teammate on your team. While this game doesn't exactly do this, it does it in a similar way. You go to jail, turn the shadow good, and then leave again, only to do the same process over and over. While this ain't THAT bad, I really hope that the future Persona games will improve on this. This is why the last bosses in Persona are always so good, because they're so different. \n\n[b] * No social links [/b]\nMakes sense, since this is a very linear game in comparison to Persona 5. Still, I've always loved the social aspect of the Persona series. Sucks that it ain't here since it's what made Persona 5 into my favorite game. \n\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\nI really enjoyed this game and I think it's a GREAT sequel. (With a few flaws.)

They took the rough Dynasty Warriors/Musou template, merged with the SMT framework and Persona 5 specific features (baton passes, One More attacks, etc), loaded up each Phantom Thief with a moveset unique and fitting to them, and set you loose.  Combat is fast and fluid, while still being tactical and having that SMT lethality that you expect.  On an overall systems level, they kept what made sense from the base game, while removing or replacing bits that wouldn't make sense (ex. Social links, strict time scheduling).  The result is a game that's paced well, has a lot of challenging and fun encounters, but rewards your growth and skill over time (and your ability to fuse personas with elemental drains and physical/gun attack skills in tandem).\n\nPlotwise, P5S is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (Royal content notwithstanding) and follows a similar enough trajectory as bit of a mirror to the Phantom Thieves' previous Metaverse adventures.  Strikers has the Phantom Thieves go on a summer road trip around Japan dealing with mysterious Jails that are appearing in concert with minor change of heart outbreaks.  In short, it's exactly what you'd expect from your favorite loudmouthed idiot social reformers on vacation, with some hilarious moments and the usual levels of \"Morgana makes stuff up about the Metaverse that ends up being accurate\".  Haru in particular is a riot due to not being saddled with the worst introduction plotline in the base game, and the new additions to the roster fit right into the group dynamic.  P5S won't break any new ground, but if you finished Persona 5 and want to spend more time with this group of miscreants, you'll have a good time with them here.\n\nAll in all, more than worth the money for SMT/P5 fans; if you're not familiar with P5 but are intrigued by this and don't mind some spoilers to the base game, it's still worth a look.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f7bb0d85207a599eae6929458d16be5a", "author": "6c31b88c307057eaa81cd35e0f39487a", "date": "2021-05-09", "hours": 626, "content": "If you're a fan of either Persona 5 or hack and slash action this could b the game for you.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f5486d03da185c25b59a4b4f5e5822ed", "author": "1beb6e20bcc65cf495e699cb81608040", "date": "2021-05-09", "hours": 3524, "content": "Great spinoff !", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f37b9666fbe159f29c23cd98e85c1ee9", "author": "15eef458139d516c8d7b26982339f705", "date": "2021-05-09", "hours": 267, "content": "AYO THIS SHIT MAD BUSSIN :100:", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e6da7fad726c56849f5e16ac8a946916", "author": "f94d4a467cad5595af58c6ab59edbc62", "date": "2021-05-09", "hours": 3655, "content": "Almost everything you wanted.\n\nSolid story line & progression combined with awesome combat mechanics!\n\nThe only downside is that the lack of confidant (which is expected)", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cfd6f3d7892e55d69a684cb57730fa61", "author": "243a4b6fc9c25d57961336cdb594c35d", "date": "2021-05-09", "hours": 173, "content": "ONE MORE GOD REJECTED\nI AM THE BUG INSIDE OF YOU\nONE MORE GOD REJECTED\nI WILL HAVE YOUR BACK TO THE WALL\nONE MORE GOD REJECTED\nSURVIVE THE FALL FROM GRACE\nYOU WON'T OPPOSE THE WRATH OF GOD\nFEAR\nFEAR GOD AND GIVE GLORY TO HIM\nFOR THE HOUR OF HIS\nJUDGEMENT\nHAS COME\nTO YOU\nNOW\nWHEN THE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE EXPIRED\nSATAN WILL BE RELEASED\nJUDGEMENT\nHAS COME\nTO YOU.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8293d1e83acb5fec899a0567cd7630ad", "author": "085153e185305b66a2d14506d15d332e", "date": "2021-05-09", "hours": 917, "content": "Its a whole album with a game included.

Can't recommend it after 10 hours, though. I don't want to continue this. Note: I have not played Persona before, but have watched it on Twitch regularly and roughly know the plot. Also, I'll try to be the devil's advocate here, but don't blame me if I get a little worked up.\nPros:\nThere's no doubt it has awesome cinematics, cool fighting mechanics and controls well. I like Anime. Occasionally, I'll watch one. It's tiring though, how in every new Anime, most of the same ideas always get recycled. Persona, on the other hand, does a good job to come up with interesting new ideas and the characters all have a unique charme to them.\nThe palaces are really fun. I like the hidden chests and objects, the relatively unique combat ideas and the Persona system.\nI played the game on normal mode and it is very well balanced. Plus, the music is great. I do believe some people are overrating the music, but it's still really spicy.\nCons:\nHear me out; I already mentioned that I like Anime. I, too, can invest lots of my time into deeper story and plot analysis. However, if I wanted to play a visual novel, I just would've. The dialogue scenes are cool at first, but they get so boring. At the same time, neither have any of my dialogue 'decisions' made ANY difference on the plot whatsoever, nor am I really willing to completely 'skip' all of them since then I'd have no idea what's going on. And the plot is what people always praise the series for, innit? I don't think it's bad to have long dialogue sequences, but they really OVERDID IT with the frequency. I've spent less time in dialogue sequences in all Life Is Strange games that have been released...\nFurthermore, one is SO limited! I can't underscore this enough. You can't even explore one shop, one sideroad, one small area without any of the characters becoming professor oak lamenting about it 'neither being the right place, nor time'. I have to strictly follow the game's idea of how it wants to be played. It's frustrating. Why, devs? Well, in Pokemon Red (1999) at leat you could enter Pokemarts. Well, ATLUS didn't even bother to animate that in 2021. Again, where is the love? If the game is set in Tokyo, at least try to make it feel like there's a cool shopping experience you can have. The food and medical items you can buy in Persona 5 Strikers are basically all the same (When it comes to TP and SP restoring), they just have different names. By the way, 'Donut-Worry' (restores some health) is the only item/thing in the game that has made me chuckle. Though likeable, the convos are never really... funny. Yeah, the don't have a good sense of humour.\nThe areas are well designed. The artwork and visuals fit perfectly. In Tokyo and other places like Sendai, however, you'll see the same 9-10 character models all the time. Humans in this game appear to be nothing but strange hollows without even a glimpse of a soul. I just really wish they (the devs) had spent more time creating a world that's actually vivid. I wish they had taken more time to make this a good game.\nThe skill tree in this game is ridiculously uncomplex (It's the complete opposite to a game like Final Fantasy X). It's not interesting, it's not individual, and it's not really challenging your decisionmaking/brain either. Heck, they don't even make you do a small minigame or the like when you cook for the rest of the party. \nHyrule Warrios, for anyone who's played that, really sucks at the plot part. But at least I get to PLAY the GAME. And I don't want to wait until I've gained freedom of movement potentially towards the end game. That's simply not a point.\nWe're in 2021 and still nobody expects your game to be as detailed as, say, the Witcher III (2015). In Contrast, with games like The Witcher existing (not a 60 Euro title by the way), how can you even legitimize putting so few love into your towns that you could basically copy from reality and didn't have to make up entirely.\nConclusion:\nI have to add, that the voice acting in this game is superb and the writing too. As english is my second language, I quite enjoy the narrative and style. To be honest, I could probably forget about the cons. Well, if this weren't a 60 Euro game, that is!\nI bought this game on Sale (52 Euro for Digital Deluxe) and that wasn't even worth it. I think at it's current state, the game isn't worth any more than 25 Euro, for there is a huge lack in love for the design of player independence. And hence they try to make it seem like your decision matters in conversations, you can't tell me they're not actually trying to establish the illusion that you do have some independence in this game.\nSince I'm done with school now, soon to be studying at university and thus am short on money, I'll have to continue this game. I merely don't have the money to buy another one. I'll come back to this review once finished. \nIf at all, please keep the comments neutral and respectful.

[/strike]\n\n\n\nTL;DR: It's a good game, and I don't recommend it for those who haven't played/experienced Persona 5 in any form or fashion.\n\n\n\nP5S is a great sequel for both the base and the Royal re-release versions of Persona 5. Admittedly I [i] am [/i] biased, as I fell in love with this game series since Royal's release and quarantine's abundance of free time. \n\nIt has more of the characters that you love and more of the strategies you employed in P5, all wrapped up with fast-paced hack n' slash gameplay and a decent story that adds new characters that I'll refrain from mentioning any further. If this is your first game with the Phantom Thieves, I sincerely recommend that you [i] not [/i] start here, as all the pre-existing characters are already established in this sequel, and the game wastes [i] no [/i] time re-introducing them or their character arcs. If you don't understand what's going on from the beginning, you'll have to catch up on a lot in your own time, or just run around like a headless chicken and beat the h#%l out of the computer pixels with your skillful excellent button pressing.\n\nMy first run-through of mastering the game (Finishing the story and completing [b] all [/b] of the requests, side-bosses, etc.) took me exactly 69 [spoiler] nice [/spoiler] hours and so-and-so minutes on Hard mode, though I certainly took my time.\n\nI also went through a Merciless NG+ run (only available after Mastering your first run) to finish my achievements list and unlock more powerful [strike] psychological Pok\u00e9mon [/strike] Personas, I finished the achievement list at my current playtime (130.0 hours). While I do love this game, I'm not the type to normally enjoy NG+ runs and that more or less remains the same. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you [i] absolutely [/i] thought the game was too easy. Though be warned, it may feel a lot grindier than the normal Easy/Normal/Hard mode runs.\n\nOther notable things worth mentioning:\n[list]\n[*]I only played on controller, and I recommend you do the same if possible. I'm not familiar with MnK controls, though I hear they're not the best. That preference is up to you, of course.\n[*]The music, as always, is a banger. And has been remixed to fit with this game's faster, more action-oriented combat.\n[*]The fusion system, the Velvet Room, and obtaining masks work somewhat differently compared to P5/P5R, though personally I didn't find the changes of serious significance.\n[*]There are [i] no [/i] Confidants/Social Links, in its place are the traditional RPG-like leveling up of skills, and Combat Mastery by playing different Phantom Thieves.\n[*]Speaking of which, you're able to play as any of the Phantom Thieves almost immediately. Each member has their own special variation of combos, and a unique combat skill that can alter your approach to a fight.\n[*]Unfortunately, no waifu is canon. But (actual semi-spoiler) [spoiler] a certain 5head bestgirl(?) may or may not get more screentime [/spoiler]. \n[/list]\n\n\nAll in all, Persona 5 Strikers burned my bread, revealed the troof, and stole my heart. I lost the mutual respect of my friend groups after they saw me jump into the Persona sinkhole, and after 100%'ing this game I can tell you I've only sunk in further.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "72529e653aa65852968b6419fb7a04ee", "author": "835555b0632852628e819ef10ab3bb6e", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 1883, "content": "Purse owner 5 part 3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "519f58d833b35f0b9872961e34ab9e85", "author": "d246d608b3295993822ec4953cb6a138", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 961, "content": "very nice", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "46a00e763958537fa6bb0b2cfeba6f7d", "author": "c085bca183fe5185b76f6c1a1f6eea1f", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 1477, "content": "could really use some more special effects in battle", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3dc4df44716b5763a1c099c35c9edfed", "author": "b075058355e75662be1753916d4e0ccf", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 2745, "content": "I was pretty hyped to get this game when it came out, in fact it's one of the few games I actually preordered because I knew I was getting it no matter what, since I loved persona 3,4 and 5.

I will fully admit that I am biased toward this series and ATLUS in general. So instead of listing reasons you should get this game I will do a Pro/Con/Depends list.\n\nPros: \n- Killer Soundtrack\n- Fun Hack & Slash Gameplay\n- Good Variety of Characters and Playstyles\n- Persona fusing has been changed. It now shows specific recipes for personas, even personas you don't yet own.   \n\nCons:\n- Combat/Combos/Abilities take time to learn and you will be going back to the tutorial menu when you forget which combo casts Zio. \n- No Igor or Akechi :(\n- I'll admit I'm struggling with coming up with cons, but I recommend looking at my next list to see if this game is right for you.\n\nDepends:\n- Direct sequel to Persona 5. This leaves a nice place for players to return to, but could alienate new players. It is worth mentioning that I tried my best to notice when the game made reference to the original P5 and it wasn't super frequent.\n- Shorter than most RPGs. My first run was ~55  hours. Keep in mind I did every side quest I could.\n\nHopefully this encouraged you to get the game. Overall, very fun hack and slash game that I had a hell of a time with. Don't go in looking for something super groundbreaking. Instead go in for a fun, flashy and fantastical game where a bunch of kids go on a road trip.

It even learned me how to control my subconcious mind better along the way.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. Makes good use of the Persona system and translates it to real-time combat rather than turn-based and even the music remixes are made to complement the change perfectly well! It also just plays a lot better than most Warriors games, with more focus on story to balance out the often repetitive gameplay of these kinda games. It builds more upon a world and its exploration, rather than the 'Select a battle' style most Warriors games have nowadays.\n\nWant a game that can hit you in the feels, and have a amazing soundtrack to go with it along with many other things to love in a RPG, then give this game a go for sure. Switch, Steam, both are good in their own ways.\n\nOh, and finally: Persona 3 (FES), Persona 5 Royal or just the whole Persona series for Switch and Steam when? I'm not asking this like many others are at every single chance to do so, this is even my first time doing it like this. Persona as a series, despite having watched more playthroughs than actually having played it, still really helped me understand myself more as the games show the way people work very well. Persona 4 touches upon acceptance of yourself and your bad sides, Persona 5 Strikers then goes deeper into that idea and instead goes for the way people become due to traumas or other events they might've gone through in the past and can't let go off.\n\nSo another point: If you feel you're struggling with these things, give the series a go (Or a look) and don't take everything at face value.

Starting with the good:\n\nStory's relatively straightforward, but good enough to keep you strung along. I'm about two thirds of the way through it, so maybe the last bit will blow me out of the water. If you like road trips and mysteries, you might like it.\n\nGraphics/sound/presentation are all amazing. Nothing takes you out of the game, and the music really serves the fights well. Only issues is that you will hear some soundtracks too many times, and there's no ultrawide support :(\n\nGameplay is where it gets interesting. Imagine hyrule warriors but every enemy has elemental strengths and weaknesses, and you can collect enemies like pokemon and fuze them into different, stronger fighters (called personas). There's also basic enviromental attacks that do elemental damage. Add switching between characters as well, and the result is good fun. There's an additional amount of depth in technicals, ailments, buffs/debuffs, but you don't really need to focus on them, even in hard mode. \n\nThe problem is that it, like other warrior esc games, it gets repetitive. Boss battles are supposed to freshen it up, but they mostly fight like other enemies but with quicker attacks and bigger health bars. So, you're gonna do a lot of swinging, casting a spell at a weakness, and dodging regardless of the fight, and not much else. It really would benefit with much more emphasis on inflicting technicals/ailments and switching to different personas/party members to deal damage. Then each fight requires using your brain a bit instead of how it currently is. \n\nUnlike persona 5, there's not much side stuff to do, so there isn't really much to take a break from the combat. Side quests boil down to doing combat challenges, fetching items for party members, or both. A lot of them require you backtrack through previous dungeons too. This game is really only playable for the main story.\n\nIt's still fun and I enjoy it, can't see it being worth $60 though.

While it may not have been on the steam version, I am working on that right now.\nPersona 5/Royal is my favorite game of all time. So when Atlus released this, I was exited as hell.

Some better than others but overall yes.\n\nNow onto the actual spoiler-free Review.\nWhile it is different from the Turn-Based battles of the series, it's still a very good game. As I have played some hack and slash games, While I may be a bit biased on this decision, Persona 5 Strikers is my favorite of that genera due to the characters, story, and overall feeling of the fighting. Its nice to have different abilities and still have it feeling like the main series. I still highly recommend playing P5/R before playing P5S if you can.\nThe controls are easy to understand. I personally played with a controller as thats what I use for hack and slash and persona games in general. (Xbox One and Switch Pro Controller for more background) While I dont think its impossible to play with a keyboard and mouse, it would be harder as you only have 8 ways to move. But play how you want to or have the ability to play with.\nOverall, Recommended. With a few aceptions.

Without it, you will 100% be missing out, both on specific story sections, and character (further) development.\n\nLet it also be noted that this game appears to follow Persona 5 more than Persona 5 Royal, due to missing added characters from P5R and specific portraits pulled from P5 rather than P5R. P5R also had a couple story changes, but nothing that should make you want to play P5 over P5R. Pick either one, play it, and then play this amazing game. Don't let the Musou battle system scare you away. This battle system is miles better than anything Dynasty Warriors has done since its creation.\n\n+ The Battle system is fun and skillful.

Getting the bonus BGM from the deluxe edition helped with fights to add more variety too but that is more money to be spent.\n\nI did not have any crashing problems as I played like other people seem to have had, the most recent patch might have fixed that. Some of the CG cut scenes in the beginning had some crusty frame rate but towards the end I noticed it got better. Gameplay was smooth the entire time. \n\nI paid $76 USD for the deluxe edition.

Go into Metaverse and change the hearts of villains. However, there are a few twists and turns regarding it this time around that significantly change how it feels, but I will not spoil the specifics.\nIn terms of gameplay, well, this is an action game, not a turn-based RPG. Despite that, it's an excellent translation of traditional Persona gameplay into this new genre. However, you need to be ready to actually rely on melee attacks and items instead of just spamming spells this time around, because the game will drain your SP like there's no tomorrow otherwise.\nAs far as social links are concerned, well, there are none. This is understandable, since you are supposed to already know the characters well enough for this not to be necessary. There are still a few optional sidequests that offer little bits and pieces of character development here and there, but for the most part the game is focused on the main story -- that's not to say that no development occurs [i]during[/i] said main story, though: it certainly does, especially for the new characters.\nAlso, Sophie very cute.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7a387f89815351aa9eca91a9d8155620", "author": "33f03c897c945a49ac540db4b6e9668d", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 3246, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers it's a really great game but you definitely need to play Persona 5 Vanilla/Royal for better understanding.

The game is still split in 2 sections, the Metaverse and the  real world. \n\nThe gameplay in the Metaverse is mostly the same as Persona 5's, except for the combat. You'll navigate around, hide in corners and ambushing enemies the same, but instead of turn-based combat it's a Dynasty Warriors style. The fights don't span the entire map like other entries in the genre, but are instead in small, restricted areas. Most of the Persona fight aspects are still there, using Personas to attack, taking advantage of elements, all out attacks, and the like. Ambushes against weaker enemies usually ends up with an immediate All-Out-Attack and winning immediately, though tougher fights do take more time as expected. While fighting, you have 3 teammates with you, which you can control both in fights and while exploring the dungeons. Each teammate has a unique playstyle too.\n\nIn the real world, things are very dialed back compared to the full Persona games. There are no Confidants/Social Links, and most of the confidants from 5 are gone, but not unmentioned. There are no romance options, either. There's no stats to build. There's no time limit on completing the dungeons, you are free to leave and re-enter them as much as you want as opposed to progressing to the next day as is usual. Most of your time in the real world is spent either shopping for items, completing tasks for rewards like new weapons, or just doing story-related tasks such as getting info on the next dungeon boss.\n\nThe story itself I have not completed, but from what I have played it is very enjoyable. The game is very much a sequel to Persona 5, the original version, not Royal. It's nice to come back to the Phantom Thieves.\n\nOverall, while the Metaverse side is quite fun and familiar, the real world side feels lacking and leaves me wanting more. However, I'd still recommend this game. It's still a fun game and the team is as enjoyable as ever, but playing the game makes me want to revisit Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3061cd8e052a50fc95b2a27e84a7456e", "author": "255d6fa32c195f0c97029fbca4b173e9", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 708, "content": "gameplay is too good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! play iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "18ded86b92d654b3976c90338f5b423f", "author": "7f710c62f0805c90afca90409a7d321b", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 930, "content": "BRING P5 ROYAL ON STEAM !!!!!!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 67, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f7b471f10ab35f4eaf23472a3c02c1c1", "author": "c62aa28f7f2a5275b58d5bc3d2219761", "date": "2021-04-24", "hours": 542, "content": "very nice", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e62ab642f1985d6e93bb4bd77e144acc", "author": "0ee97d53c93a5cd18fe747f011863120", "date": "2021-04-24", "hours": 2340, "content": "great story, fun gameplay but could use more content and variety.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a822660f805459bcac831f6e9f234c6f", "author": "f0b51ddb97d5547db6dfc2b8a04998fc", "date": "2021-04-24", "hours": 264, "content": "it's fun but lags when you are trying to stream it...", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a481649d42155825b984a05760c22e38", "author": "dcf4682fd6f05628928d95d5adc1b753", "date": "2021-04-24", "hours": 780, "content": "It's a persona game, and it doesn't let you down.\n\nExcept for the controls.\nA controller would be better.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a26da0624b975d9199553cd78c6ecaff", "author": "b51ac5e232255d39921128e167bde43d", "date": "2021-04-24", "hours": 209, "content": "Amazing Game.

I think that this game is pretty neat, I wouldn't have had put as many hours as i have put into it if I didn't enjoy it. \n\nParts of the game could have been better, though a lot of my criticisms have been already addressed by a lot of people though I'll say that how leaving the dungeon and coming back to restore hp and more importantly sp is kinda dumb that it just doesn't heal automatically, I guess its to have the feeling of during new game plus or whatever the player can feel like they didn't need to come back and rejuvenate but doesn't really feel like its needed aside from possibly needing to stock up on items which could just be done anyways.\n\nThe story is fine I liked parts of it can't say I'm too much of a fan though even if it is just mostly dumb fun, I like some of the new characters but that's about it. \n\nThe game would crash on me a unusual amount of times for almost no explainable reason, I detected a pattern some of the time with like traveling between the velvet room and back or like leaving the game on in the background for a realllllly long time and then it would crash after some transition back to the real world, but other times i really couldn't explain why like during story events, so I just got used to save somewhat often since it barely takes that much time.\n\nI got a unusual amount of time trying to assemble some heavy hitting personas (even if lucifer is just the best for dealing with large groups) and figuring out a lot of the different combos that come with those personas and even different party members, its all built pretty well. In the case of joker though being able to switch out to a persona that nulls or absorbs a attack was pretty satisfying though it also kinda feels like there's not really a reason not to freeze time to null a attack instead of like dodging or something, due to how most attacks don't really move when you freeze time and select a different persona, aside from some attacks acting during that time but barely ever happens. I think if a sequel or a different SMT spin off as there could be a lot to expand on here gameplay wise. \n\nIf you like this series there's not really a reason to not get the game but just gonna say I'd wait for a discount because despite all the good I don't think its worth 60 bucks, and I especially don't think it was worth 70 bucks even if I got to access it 3 days early and some music dlc/extras which in all honesty ain't much : P (Or you could just buy it anyways). ~~I'm sure I'll complain about the price of things more as soon as nocturne hd comes out~~", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "895bb072d63451a38d3d66ae7a709db2", "author": "2958313c75e653cfb8b4027f290dd8df", "date": "2021-04-23", "hours": 191, "content": "I love the game guyse. it is really fun. i did a gameplay walk through video for the beginning of the game. you can check it here in my youtube channel. i do walk through videos for new payed games too. support me by subscribing and do likes. there is a new game weekly posted. thanks everyone.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw0-SPTsNBc", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7b150e82e524545e814332472ca74e3d", "author": "33af82a43fe85497b7d4381247ff8735", "date": "2021-04-23", "hours": 17, "content": "haruharuharuharuharuharuharuharu", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4c12741dffe3556e84398c19cf6f6ce5", "author": "37d9094d82455b619f5542e40a8b497b", "date": "2021-04-23", "hours": 1660, "content": "RYUJI SAYS THE F WORD.

Those big brawls are there, but most mob fights are far more similar to a traditional persona confrontation, against a handful (around 10) enemies with different weaknesses, and we could always pause the action by holding down the right bumper, so it's a real-time with pause action game.\n\nEverything takes place within the summer holidays, so Strikers is shorter in both story and character development, but the main cast is as likable as ever. The timeline is a direct continuation from the original P5, but it's somewhat jarring that the other characters seem to have forgotten their relationship (if any) with Joker. Also, considering that the Phantom Thieves are already embedded in the public consciousness and they're stirring up quite a storm this time, it's awkward to not hear a single peep from their outer circle of confidants. The Mishima we know would have gone ballistic from the stuff they're doing this time around.\n\nGameplay-wise, party members mostly reprise their original roles in P5. For example, Skull is still a powerhouse in boss fights; he's actually better than Joker until Joker's personas are fully developed. Mona is still a reliable wind hitter / heal battery, and he can transform into his van form to road rage into enemies again and again. Fox's playstyle centers around countering single physical hits with his own, and a few members can imbue their normal hits with their native element, bypassing physical resistance or immunity. Ammo fully regenerates after every fight. Noir (when mastered) can shoot for free, and certain members have ways to replenish mid-fight.\n\nThis time around, the Personas and fusion system are a bit more interesting. Having come from the original P3 and P4, it was far too easy in P5 (and P4G) to put any skill into any persona, rendering the nuance in inheritance slot limitations, elemental restrictions, and multiple fusions completely moot. I'm pretty sure everyone's glad that random inheritance is gone, but P5's system made it such that personas without unique skills are only as good as their innate resistances or growth potential i.e. the lower their initial level, the better, so many personas that start at high level, e.g. Messiah and many arcana capstones, are no good. It made no sense.\n\nIn this game, there are no personas locked behind DLC, and on top of the 8 skill slots, each persona has up to 3 combo skills that cost no SP or HP. These are innate to each persona, and they restore personas' much-needed identity. For example, want to combo into a free maziodyne? Thor is our only pick. Mara has its own unique combo-only severe fire skill called maralagidyne. Skill cards are still there, but they cannot modify these combo skills, and the best ones only drop at the very end of the post-game of NG+, so if we want good personas earlier on, especially when just going into Risky / Merciless difficulty, fusion is the way to go. There's also no limit on persona stat growth, so if we have the resources, there's no problem enhancing all stats to 99.\n\nDefense passives such as absorb element that are traditionally extremely powerful in turn-based persona, are not very relevant here, because we could just switch to another persona at any time. Enemy moves are clearly telegraphed, and baton pass, showtime, as well as all-out attacks all confer generous iframes, on top of dodge roll. That's before factoring in the omnipotent orb. It's a very interesting change-up in terms of how an end-game persona is supposed to look like.\n\nThere's also surprisingly little grind in this game, which is really welcome. I'm sitting at 100% completion with about 100 hours on my file from just playing through normally, and Joker's personas and four other members are already all maxed out. If you want to max everyone's stats with incenses, that will take a few hours fighting the reaper on Merciless difficulty (he drops 75 incenses in one go). Or if you absolutely need some skill card, e.g. any drain card. For that, good luck, because some of the drop rates are really, really low.\n\nAs for things that could be improved, a persona's combo moves aren't shown in the compendium, so the only way to know is to try them out or look them up. Analog movement is also really iffy even when using a controller; your character is locked into 8 directions of movement. It's bad when moving around, but surprisingly enough, it doesn't get in the way during fights.\n\nAs a separate issue, once Joker's personas get powerful enough, it becomes possible to just endlessly stunlock most bosses by inflicting burn, freeze, or shock, and then literally just doing hassou tobi / vacuum wave over and over with knockdown style and technical adept. That's... a really boring way to play the game, but it's also the fastest way to bring down the boss. That's no good.\n\nHere's to a simultaneous PC release for P6, eh Atlus? Maybe include a difficulty option to disable skill cards for fusion purists.\n\nA few tips for Risky / Merciless difficulty: Start with at least a good persona or two, e.g. Yoshi, and max Navi's HP first, for the defense sections. The best way to spawn treasure demons for money and skill cards is to just move around or change zones when alert level is in the red, after clearing at least one group. They have a distinctive way of scooting around the minimap, and they give off a continuous tinkle even when not in line of sight. In the final dungeon, treasure demons give 750k yen with the money accessory, and you should be able to get one to spawn every 5 minutes or less. Dire shadows are best for bond points. For PP, just keep enhancing and dismissing the same persona over and over.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't miss this if you're a persona fan.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "631a7adc55445ea5a6fac880dbeb45f8", "author": "e7889f03848950cc86496ba5564fca9f", "date": "2021-04-22", "hours": 2946, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is still Persona, but instead of Turn based you get Warriors-style hack-n-slash battles.

So just to say upfront: Strikers is fucking great. As someone that played a single Dynasty Warrior game like two decades ago, hated it, and never played another, this was an amazingly fun experience. That said, it's defiantly still a Persona game, which is good. Weakness and Technical attacks are the biggest key to actually getting anything done so it's not just mindlessly spamming the same combo every which way the wind blows. Technical hits in particular are vastly more important then in P5/Royal since you can Ailment bosses and especially trigger Technical hits that will chip away at enemy shields (which is necessary for the few enemies with no Weaknesses).\n\nI would only recommend people interested to hold off if they haven't played P5/Royal since it is a sequel. On that note, the events of Strikers seem to be based off the ending of P5 rather then the true ending of Royal.

In short, this game is fun as hell.  Now for the long part.  The combat is fast paced and has interesting mechanics to boot.  You would think that pausing the game in order to select a skill from a menu would be detrimental to the pace of battle, but it actually isn't. Furthermore, every member of the Phantom Thieves has their own unique playstyle, which kind of implies that each PT member has their own situational usage.  Joker has his usual \"wild card\" sitch, Ryuji is the heavy, Morgana becomes a car, Ann has an enchant, Yusuke is a Fire emblem character, you can finally ride Makoto's bike, Haru is a beyblade, and the two new characters each have their own thing going on too.  Sophia is a great addition to the PT, acting as kind of a Morgana 2.0 from P5, (she navigates the PT to and through the Jails, which are like Palaces from P5, so no Sophia means no game) considering she's an amnesiac who has no clue what her origin is.  However, instead of being quite annoying like our favorite mascot, Sophia ends up being one of the most likable characters in the whole game.  Then there's Zenkichi, who's basically Dojima from P4 [spoiler] but he's a Persona user [/spoiler].  He is also an amazing addition to the PT, acting as a kind of \"team dad,\" who looks out for and genuinely cares about his team, his family, and justice.  The villains in this game are also pretty great.  Instead of being one-dimensional hate sinks like in P5 (not R), these guys have more depth to their actions, usually acting the way they are due to trauma and abuse from earlier points in their lives.  Main bad guy is kind of a toss up though, since I still think Shido had so much going on in P5 that it's really hard to even come close to him, and [spoiler] Konoe [/spoiler] felt less diabolical once you learn his backstory.

Combat is fun but some fights can drag on too long. The plot is fine, nothing special but having the gang all together in new places has some great interactions. If you are a fan of the Phantom Thieves and can stomach the potential crashes and gameplay issues, get it. If you aren't invested in the characters, there isn't much reason to get this over other action games.\n\ncrashes - In the 60 hrs it took me to beat the game on normal and do all requests, the game crashed several times during loading screens. There are few things more frustrating than beating a tedious optional boss and then the game crashing when you leave the area.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, each story boss has a unique design and arena that makes their fight interesting. Mini-bosses not so much, they felt more like tedious resource drains. The optional bosses even more so, spamming skills to destroy their guard just to have your fully upgraded all-out-attack move the hp bar 10 pixels doesn't feel great.\n\nUnlike other musou games, melee kinda takes a back seat. The combination of melee doing small chip damage and 100 things flying around the battle, makes melee risky and unrewarding and persona skills far superior. Other than generic grunts, if you are approximately the same level as an enemy they don't especially care about any attacks that aren't the element they are weak against. Each character has a combo or 2 that deal their element as damage without using sp, but the real deal hits harder. You're gonna want to stock up on sp recovery for challenging fights.\n\nThere are some fun character interactions as the thieves interact with each other in new situations and environments. I also love the new characters.

Being able to play as any character in your party is a nice touch and having (almost) every beloved Phantom Thief unlocked right away is a good touch. Joker's Wild Card still lets you get Personas, but now instead of convincing them to join you they will instead sometimes drop masks when defeated.

The mini-bosses are fun and should be integrated more and much more often. \n\n-In my 60 hour gameplay, I crashed 5 times. That's not really game breaking but a bit annoying. And it's random too.

Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5.

The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found.

I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay.

A lot of the time It was hard to follow what is going on in fights and the difficulty spike on the first mini boss was jarring. I think again story wise the game is pretty good more time with the phantoms thieves and overall comes to a satisfying conclusion. The game play is the weak point for me, I also wish the hub cities were bigger/had more to do, with all that the game is worth getting for story alone and the overall environments the jails present are visually really cool, but again I had trouble with the fighting/abilities or really investing in any of the other characters abilities( played joker pretty much exclusively) *spoiler really sucks if you haven't done this by the end of the game*. recommend for story but game play is hard to get into that's just my opinion.

It\u00b4s more time with the phantom thieves and their members, which is great. Sure, you dont have to manage school-life or your confidances, and battles are fought in real time, but it still FEELS all Persona 5-ey. If you played the original (or Royal) you know what I mean, the style, the music and the whole atmosphere.\nIt\u00b4s just a bit different, but I would like to stress that that\u00b4s not a bad thing. You just feel a different kind of rush and excitement when you have to control the movements of the thieves directly in battle, The change in genre fits surprisingly well (at least for me)! Before you had all these thievy characters in a rather static battle-system, this one allows you to experience much better how the phantom thieves sneak around enemies or weave through them, and it feels awesome.\n\nSo yeah, watch Queen screaming FIST OF JUSTICE while the new Last Surprise track is blasting and try to tell me you dont love this. \n\n10/10, more \"For reals\"s from Ryuji\n11/10 Ryuji drops the f-bomb finally", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "62aca2502f7c5bd4a025950c11445d72", "author": "b5fb62d10e555d55a58b912624ba98ac", "date": "2021-04-08", "hours": 4112, "content": "its a Very good game to those who have played Persona 5, and Persona 5 Royal, the story and gameplay is amazing, but id recommend you play on a controller because playing mouse and keyboard is a bit weird for the people who are used to controls from p5/p5R Definitely would recommend until they patch the Bug", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4c3d4b18803c5dc08f53bbe1fb0c079d", "author": "95adcb846f4959038e681f7aa65ed968", "date": "2021-04-08", "hours": 1324, "content": "A Worthy Follow up to the persona 5 story.\nGameplay is great, not what i'm used to with the \nmain game's but great nontheless.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "39d95ec9071a5c7db9188428f327fd38", "author": "92773e3e78345e959a050acd60f3bee7", "date": "2021-04-08", "hours": 1076, "content": "While P5S has its downsides, it makes it up amazingly with a very fresh combat experience, a new interesting story, more of the characters you already loved (if you already played P5) and lots of fun to boot.\nAll in all, if you liked P5 for the universe around it and not specifically the gameplay, you may find this one to be right in your alley.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "18461986a1af5aa7857a02cbc8e355a8", "author": "b18a8e9b12255e8d9a451ccfefabfbe5", "date": "2021-04-08", "hours": 734, "content": "Excellent game, i am very familiar with this kind of play style from games like Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors, but at the same time, still has its lovely Persona Vibe and Story.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f9717b929c78579fa23440890aaf4c60", "author": "1e894ec270c151bbb4e4fffca01b826b", "date": "2021-04-07", "hours": 2851, "content": "I like the gameplay in P5S but the story and bugs make me fume.

Although the developments from Persona 5 Royal are kinda disregarded here, I'd recommend playing that instead of base P5, if not for the improvements on the base game then purely for the Third Semester.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a hefty addition spanning (in my case) 50 hours long. A third of P5R and half of P5. The combat here heavily resembles that of dynasty warriors, in which you have to fight off hordes of opponents in real time with 3 more phantom thieves by your side. The story here is kind of weak compared to P5R, but still really enjoyable and fulfilling besides. If you have played P5 or P5R, I'd highly recommend this game as despite the main 8 thieves not getting much character development (as they already got all of it from their confidants in P5), it is still nice seeing them ebb and flow off each other and the two new main characters.\n\nTime to go on a trip with P5S and steal back some desires.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "476d9bb5f9d05fae8f82a52f2da0d997", "author": "b2389eb58e525f9b8d8ffa270ee19b72", "date": "2021-04-07", "hours": 2026, "content": "Its pre good.

Though of course, HIGHLY recommend that you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before entering here as you'll get to be more attached to the characters beforehand.\n\nI've never really played any kind of game like this in the past so I started on normal and that was already a good enough challenge personally. So don't worry about starting on normal if you're not looking for a challenge, that's why there's a merciless mode for those who want to challenge themselves. I think starting on hard mode is also a good enough challenge for those starting out. \nI think the gameplay is near perfect for those who want to either take it back and just play casually and those who really want to challenge themselves. The mechanics are simple but if you want to be able to maximise your output you have to be strategic with quite a lot of things. Combo's with normal attacks, combo's into your persona, and evading your enemy, while you can button mash, you'll get punished for not knowing what you do in hard boss fights and especially on merciless mode. Merciless will destroy you if you aren't being conscious of what you're doing in terms of attacks and spacial awareness, if you get caught by an enemy you'll most likely be dead, your entire party included.\nStarting on normal and then switching to hard later on I feel is the best thing to do. Normal will teach you the main mechanics well while hard will challenge you on using those mechanics to the best of your abilities. Merciless will challenge everything you have mechanics and resource wise. \n\nWhile the story isn't too heavy handed in terms of twists and complexity, it's a very enjoyable one with barely any bad moments. The dynamics between the characters are honestly written very well and they really do feel like a band of merry friends at the end of the day. And the new characters are amazing too, they're a very nice addition to the group.\nMusic is top notch, seriously, I don't have a single song I hate in this game. From city vibing, to the many and various battle themes, there's so much to enjoy.\nAnd I do love me some boss fights. I really do like all of them. While some have some annoying mechanics, they aren't frustrating to deal with.\n\nIf you've seen other reviews, then you've seen that this game has a complaint of crashing. And yes it does, I had quite a few in the beginning but I kind of learned a trick that could help others if you're having the issue as well.\nDuring transition screens whether that's areas, the metaverse, or after boss battles, that's where the game usually crashes (at least for me). Don't furiously click or press any keys during these transitions. Rapid clicks or pressing of the keyboard have caused like, 99% of my crashes so while it may be different for others, those with the issues may find that this will help and hopefully it does.\n\nBut yeah, it's an amazing game.

If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4e08e4a74e2559c98919612f54f65eb1", "author": "df9aab7dbdc058dca257201cc62d64e5", "date": "2021-04-06", "hours": 2676, "content": "great game, very enjoyable, requires some button remapping to work though 9/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "484a9e8da0dd5d43ae874d451a25b705", "author": "1102207cb51852fd8530a06c97c73026", "date": "2021-04-06", "hours": 2136, "content": "Ryuji is now holding the F word pass.

The OST, group, and overall atmosphere was something I really enjoyed. With Persona 5 Strikers coming, I was looking forward to catching up with the Phantom Thieves. Seeing the characters and the world yet again felt a burst of memories from the original title. This game mixes up its gameplay with introducing a more Dynasty Warriors feel (well, it's made by the developers). So the game is HEAVY on the mobs of enemies you face with each character having their own personal combos/moves to perform in combat. The \"Palace\" aspect for the dungeons has been changed (won't say for spoiler sake), but it's more or less the same format. \n\nComing up on my personal opinion of the game being halfway through, it's kinda... meh? It's not a bad thing in no way, but the game does tend to just be rinse and repeat constantly. Gameplay is good enough to continue playing, but the story just kinda wanes as it goes by. If you're someone who wanted to wait for a sale, I say do so. You're not gaining or losing anything from playing/not playing the game. It's just more Persona 5. If that's what you've been yearning for, you won't be disappointed in that regard. The OST is great as usual for a Persona game. My overall first impressions of everything are fairly solid. Regardless, if you played the original Persona 5/Royal and have missed the Phantom Thieves, then this is definitely that game to scratch that itch.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8669ece53f1854869e296ce884aaec38", "author": "68d9262216fc5edfadd49c34be9648b8", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 1225, "content": "COOL GAME I CAN BE JOKER AND I LOOK LIKE JHOKER IN REAL LIFE", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "54e48d5f19cd5cdf821a9924555b2d81", "author": "f9b5acd1f35f540db7dfff5007695afc", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 5703, "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal and enjoyed them, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this game. However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5125273ffff2559293ada315d1470355", "author": "98789383184a524f956b10f6a4eaf222", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 922, "content": " i have always enjoyed persona games story plots- but its very nice change of pace not to have to worry about calendars/social links-", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "489f00736276585db8739c1e5f71f540", "author": "64ababf2f7d15735b5acd10ec128b733", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 5, "content": "no ultrawide support? for a $70 game? what?

If you did this game is much more than just a musou and I definitely recommend it.\n\nWhile it doesn't have social links and the calendar system this game is pretty much a sequel to Persona 5.\n\nAlmost all the elements from the original turn-based combat system are also present in the new real time combat of Strikers even if they work a bit differently. Affinities, skills, Persona fusion (obviously not to the same extent), the dungeon crawling; it's all there and it's fun!\n\nThe story doesn't only take place in Shibuya this time, it's a roadtrip across Japan and the changing scenery/locations constantly keep things interesting. The new characters are great, the music is fantastic as always. All the characters play differently with their own unique mechanics and due to the affinity system you need to pick the right party and persona loadout for Joker for the right bosses/encounters.\n\nThe story is decent, it starts out very solid but unfortunately runs out of steam close to the end. The pacing is all over the place. The last boss is [spoiler]pretty much the same as the one from vanilla Persona 5 (literally the same being if you know a bit about gnosticism...)[/spoiler], so I wasn't really paying much attention at the end anymore, it just felt like a repeat and the phantom thieves were saying very similar lines that didn't have much of an impact anymore.\n\nThe combat can get very tedious especially in the late game. Even on Normal difficulty some bosses and shadows will have very high HP pools while your party members can die in 2-3 hits. You spend alot of time just whittling away at their life until you manage to knock them down for an all out attack which maybe does like 10% of their HP. I understand they wanted the combat to be more strategic and focused on exploiting enemy weaknesses but at some point it just stops being fun. Especially when the party member AI occasionally has a brain fart and just lets bosses one shot them with highly telegraphed attacks.\n\nDespite all this I still had a very good time with Strikers and I think anyone who liked Persona 5 also will.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b41413d991f450d1bd4b50bb19a089eb", "author": "6d4421a40b0d574782b1b3c1c1bf1ff4", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 3224, "content": "How many?\nAre you sure?\nHow many?\nAre you sure?\nHow many?\nAre you sure?\nHow many?\nAre you sure?\nYou're buying quite a bit!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 307, "funny": 218, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "55e0045820265466b9d227515396b557", "author": "2a56f71d5b125e21bba1e2159838217d", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 1443, "content": "The default controls suck but the game's good if you change your keybinds", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4958f632a71351309e3ad4ed33d2e4cc", "author": "da59a88762825874a9e7f5e63fa2a326", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 2294, "content": "big persona vibes\ngood game, would recommend.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "47b1200813ed5a79ace581584705cf49", "author": "6674ca7cf2835f729d171e91707f9c98", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 2296, "content": "Futaba forgot that I dated her :^(", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "401b8bf9bd8c5c12a344eb46de4c2717", "author": "b718ca3235e7559cbe5ef5ed4c036425", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 983, "content": "Great game, fun combat, great characters.\n\nBut I would kindly ask to bring persona 5 royal to PC please.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "337c46150e235fdbb5d957c952bc7637", "author": "e222014b52c35e889ae42197ae5f928c", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 284, "content": "This game has a Persona 5 theme, with a  Kingdom Hearts / Beatem up style gameplay.

The writing is incredible as always and the characterization and interactions are arguably better than og persona 5 and royal.  The setting of the game as a summer roadtrip around Japan is genius and was a great breath of fresh air besides the familiar area of Shibuya.  The two main new characers Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions especially Zenkichi.  The visuals are also very pretty and refined especially the in-game cut scenes which honestly looked better than the anime cut scenes.  Overall I wanted more persona 5 and that's what this game gives you, exactly what I needed around this time.  The only complaints I have are the persona system with joker could be done a little better compared to previous p5 games, Lavenza and the velvet room in general should've been used in the plot a bit more or just change things up and make it more unique rather than \"Oh guess what you're a trickster of fate again\", and the plot near the end is pretty predictable and similar to P5R.  I can see why people don't like Sophia as well being the whole AI learns about the concepts of humanity thing but Sophia's interactions and expressions were very cute so it made up for it.  Every character gameplay wise is incredibly fun the best in my opinion being Makoto, Ryuji, and wolf(won't say who wolf is cuz spoilers) but the only complaint I have gameplay wise is Sophia, in a muso game I want to do big flashy moves or badass combos, with so much happening on the screen why would I want to practice timing perfect catches with a yoyo for sophia's combos how can I read her catches while watching every other enemy and dodging attacks, functionally her bless magic and healing are very helpful but that's all I really used her for her magic for bosses and mini bosses who were weak to bless or just healing team members she's the only character I found my self barely using in combat.\nOverall 9/10 very surprised and excited to do New Game +", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7264e6a36b1658eb9c8053c11be9e26d", "author": "884aa39717ac5425a43403a75eeffc75", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 3706, "content": "Very fun sequel to the original Persona 5 so you don't need to play the Royal version to enjoy it.

HOWEVER, some significant flaws like aiming guns are broken as your crosshair moves up and down like an earthquake simply from moving it in either left or right directions.\n\nThe store is also watered down a tad as you used to be able to sell all your junk with a push of a button in persona 5. with strikers, you must sell each item individually as the \"sell all junk\" button does not exist anymore.\n\nEverything else gameplay-wise was fine from what I have seen except for some exploits due to how far you can jump to places, and in certain areas, if you look up, you can pass entier areas without going to the actual entrance, which I accidentally did and backtracked to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe story is..... how to put it..... probably the worst thing about this game. The removal of all the supporting members from the game and being left with just a few new ones hurt the story badly. The hub world feels empty because of this, as there is nothing to do or get more investment in the story (at least from what I saw from beating the first palace). \nThe story also feels completely unrelated to me, as the stakes for beating any of the palaces are super low. While in the first game, the cops in the story would have arrested you the moment you were suspicious, even at the last scene of the game. In this one, it feels like no one cares (except for one guy) despite you being a phantom thief. You actually had severe consequences in the story in the first one, but in this game, it's just a straight path with some little stumbles and no risk. Maybe it gets better after the first palace, but I didn't care to continue as it felt pointless. i could compare this to mementos side stories, but with extra flair. that's basically it.\n\nI'm sure some people love this stuff, and gameplay-wise, it's obviously not bad.

I love how this game took the idea of the Phantom Thieves and brought the question of how humanity acts and relies on free will and isolation. I felt like all of the Monarchs were in the position that they are purely because of how they fell off their paths in life instead of just being pure evil. This led to the change of hearts being much more believable and made me wonder how the Monarchs got to be the leaders of the jail every time I got to a new one and how we were going to save them.

If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention some of the personas need to be fuse with a the early personas at certain level for example, King Frost - Lvl 40 Jack Frost + Lvl 40 Jack O' Lantern. Jack frost should be around level 20 when you get him, and Jack O Lantern is Level 8, So if you didnt level them up or dont have enough Persona points, it is gonna take some time to get some of the personas.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2e4d48873d895930854328d4ee81733d", "author": "8062496c04345a19b47da51729e51af7", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 1088, "content": "Don't usually play beatemup games but this was the exceptions with Persona 5 slapped onto it and I think you can really tell that this game was created with a lot of love.

First off is the fact that the game likes crashing a lot and it also has a few glitches which might force you to close, which really sucks when you spend 30 minutes on the final boss fight and it crashes the next cutscene and I have to fight the boss all over again.\n\nNext is the story in General: If you played Persona 5, then you know the story of Persona 5: Strikers. There are bad guys in these palace like jails and it's up to the Phantom Thieves to change their hearts and take back their desires. Of course there is actually a false god who has been secretly pulling the strings and manipulating everything. It feels like you are playing a watered down fanfiction rather than an actual sequel with how similar it is to the main story. The only unique part of the story being Sophia but even then her plot is barely touched until the very end.\n\nNext are the characters: The main cast is back but it doesn't feel like they are back. They all act like parodies of themselves, like someone saw one scene in Persona 5 and based their entire personality off it. While its charming at first listening to the cast talk and crack jokes, there is only so many times we can hear about Ryuji's food obsession or Makoto's fist of justice or Yusuke being poor. The villains are all forgettable, their backstory is paper thin and the game tries to make it seem like they are morally grey characters or arent truly evil, but they dont even keep this pattern up half the time. Some villains are complete assholes who murder their parents, while others are boring and barely even criminals, like the guy who wrote a bad book. It felt like there was an attempt to make a villain who is good, but uses the wrong method like Takuto Maruki from Royal, but they all fall short. Maruki worked so well because he was a good guy and actually was attempting to do good, even if his methods and ways were wrong. The villains that try to seem redeemable are all murders whose control other people to force them to do their bidding. Even the twist villain who everyone could see coming just felt dry, like they needed someone to explain why EMMA even became a god in the first place.\n\nGameplay: The game play seems fun at first, but it quickly gets old after a while, it is just beat up the enemy, move forward, wow another ambush, beat up the enemy, fight a 10 minute mini boss, fight a 30 minute boss. There is just too much combat that feels unrewarding and dry, The time outside of the metaverse feels empty, like a poor imitation of the main games open world. The time progression system is completely uselss, and there is little to do outside except shop for groceries so you can have more sp and complete side request which just waste more time. Every area felt the same with no uniqueness, every battle felt the same, learn the enemies weaknesses and spam the move that works. Unlike the main game, which had a lot of flair, each battle lacks anything close to the art style and flair of the main game as you see all the game has to offer in about and hour of game play. God bless anyone who didnt buy the Legacy music because I could not stand listening to the same three combat songs over and over again. \n\nOverall this game is not worth $60, maybe $40 but i wouldn't go any higher, just wait for a sale if you really want it, also atlus pls fix your game I want to go one cutscene without crashing pls", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9652f7cae3e955648d7749f655595f0f", "author": "0cc6b2b0d0d056a3852bc13450be8193", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 299, "content": "played this game pirated for 4 hours before and decided to actually buy it.\nxander mobus is hott", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "877fe35683be5c4fb81da29d56f5befc", "author": "63839a99016e51fcaaa090d341bda339", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 2204, "content": "A sequel to Persona 5 thinly veiled as Persona Warriors.

Contains a lot from base Persona 5, except social links and a restricted free roam. Time does not pass in this game when you do any sort of action, but instead only passes through story. It does feel rather cheaply made at first, though, since you can't run while free roaming, and all but two non party confidants were completely removed from the game because of [strike] low budget [/strike] convenient reasons. However, it shouldn't take much time to adjust to this.\n\nThe only gripe I can give this game is the combat. It works, but it's not great. Be warned, you will be dropped from full HP to 0 in less than a second many times in this game, and that's the game's biggest issue. I don't think they realized just how strong enemy moves were, so when you have 7 of them doing the same move all at once, it packs one hell of a punch. The majority of persona moves are also rather useless. Really, I never once used a physical skill, and I only used a magic skill a hand full of times. The only worth while skills in this game are stat buffs/debuffs, heals, and passives. Everything else, including skills like concentrate and charge, are completely worthless. Also, anything that was meant to hit all targets in the base game is also completely useless. It just costs more SP with a wider area of affect. Normal trash enemies don't need any debuffs to fight. The only thing you should use debuffs on is for anything that has a health bar on the top of the screen, and since it's only one enemy, you can save double the SP for just using the smaller area of effect debuffs.\n\nOverall, it's Persona 5 through and through with the only major change being Action RPG combat.

Not gonna work.\" \n\nThe more I looked into it, the more it started to grow on me. Ended up pre-ordering sometime in January. Got it 3 days early because of the Deluxe order. Wow.\n\nI am so glad I picked this up. I fell in love with the Persona series when I got to try out Persona 4. Dark, Gritty, comical and pretty real when it came to terms and understanding characters. Played the original and P4 Golden. Absolutely loved every aspect of the game. Saw it released on steam and bought it without even thinking. :)\n\nThen P5 was announced!\nPre-orderd the box set before the prices when to crap before release. Completely loved the game and finished it.\nPersona 5 Royal. . . . CRAP! got to get it! Started to replay the game with the extras and to experience the new section of the story. Got about 76 hours into the game and lost everything past the 16 hour mark after a brown out. Forgot to upload to PS plus. Also, long story short. PS4 Pro, No Internal harddrive. Modified external with 8tb Barracuda Pro. Every brownout/ loss of power wiped the drive. After that happened, 2 tb SSD with the 8tb in a usb3 case. Works fine now but added a 1000 UPS unit to it. Honestly haven't touched it since\n\nStrikers though, I was positively blown away by how well this worked. A Dynasty Warriors take on Persona is certainly refreshing way to spin off an already great game. All of the characters we know and love are spot on and the VA's reprized their rolls wonderfully{save for Joker}. Absolutely love Zenkichi and Sophia and the parts they play. The gameplay was fluid and fast paced when needed and the music from the original games and the reprized Musou variants plus their original takes work perfectly for the new style of gameplay. Even the subtle change in the music when you went into the sneak sections was a pleasing change. I wonder how many people caught onto that change when they played those parts.\n\nThe story played out very well and was a pretty good length. I was surprised that it totaled almost 33 hours without doing the extra mission. It is pretty engrossing if you ask me with all of the comical, stereotypical, and serious character building while keep the balance of surreal, light, and dark positions each and every character goes through and faces during each mission or challenge.\n\nAll in all. The Highlights about the games really to make this a great play Save for the few things that I have found that started to break the immersion of the game. First off, The VA's did a wonderful job playing their parts but I found that the sound balancing in the game started to break the game. I was finding out that alot of the music did not lower when the characters spoke and alot of time the Va's voice would start to blend or even be overpowered by the music. I heard this alot when Skull spoke his dialogue. He even had a few lines that were inaudible or something that was completely non-exhistant when he talked. The constant crashing when the game was first released, which thankfully, was fixed with the beta update they released a week or so later. But when I really started to see was the slowdown during gameplay or in full on battles. I was well above the Recommended when I was running it first on my I5 6500, OLOy DDR4 2666{Limited to 2400 because of processor}, and my 1060 GXT SSC card. I kept getting slowdowns when I had alot of effects going on in game with more than 6 enemies on screen. It was the worse when I made it to the underground \"sewer\" part of the first Prison. The section near the end of the \"sewer\" part where the water was on the floor at the end of the dungen.  Upgraded the Processor and motherboard while keeping my memory and Vid card. Ryzen 5 3600X. was the processor upgrade and the game played almost flawlessly. Even got better framerates that stayed constant 60FPS even in the final dungeon where there were up to 50+ enemies on the field. I also found it strange that there were side quest mini bosses that were incredibly hard when compared to the normal Bosses and End game boss. I died more on those side quest bosses then I did on the Main ones. Once you started to get up in levels, the enemies became to easy which made it hard to start to complete the Character quests and Move sets. Maybe I will mess with it soon in a harder difficulty mode to see if my current Mode playthrough was the reason.\n\nNow, my last quip was Joker. I guess they could not get the original VA? I mean, His voice was alot more gruff at certain points but they used alot of his Persona 5 voice clips. It was very off putting listening to him. Other than that. It was a great game and was very enjoyable to play. Now I'll just wait for any expansions or new unlockable to see in game. Heres Hoping. ;)\n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4dcb714055a55a38975010e8fd46af32", "author": "5a2d24c386cf5553a26217bc4de9273c", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 2881, "content": "TL;DR The only criteria you need to think about if you're considering playing is \"Did you like Persona 5?\" If the answer is yes, play this without question. I would NOT recommend this at all if you haven't played the original Persona 5, this builds up directly on top of Persona 5 and you'll feel lost if this is your first Persona game.\n\nI'd give this a 8.5/10, only because Persona 4 and 5 have set a very high standard, so obviously this cannot compete with that but you'll never feel like this was a low-effort cash grab. It's very much a good polished game worth your time and you shouldn't compare it to Persona 5 which had a wayyy longer development time and budget.\n\nWhile there are definitely some weak links, you'll never feel bad about it when you're playing, and I had as much a blast with this game as much as I did with the other main Persona titles. In fact, I actually prefer this action combat system over Persona's original turn-based combat. Any future Persona games using this sort of combat over turn-based combat would be a dream come true (sadly it won't happen but it's fun to think about)\n\nAgain, this is totally worth your money if you've played and liked the original Persona 5. I'm just sad it has ended and I'll have to wait a long time for another high-quality Persona game. I have very specific reasons for not giving it a perfect score but it's not for this review. I feel like there were some game design/level design issues and Sophia is an unlikable character for me personally. But then again, Persona games have always been cheesy, and all those issues won't really bother you when you're playing; they only seem worse in hindsight when you think about them afterwards.\n\nThank you Omega Force, P-Studio and Atlus for making this.

This one felt so much more personal, like the voice actors had SO MUCH FUN playing these characters and adding their personal touch to it. I especially loved the new characters as well, especially Sophia. She made me tear up multiple times. My favorite team was the P4 Investigation Team, but this game really made me connect the Phantom Thieves so much more. \n\nNow moving to combat, combat feels GOOD. Much better than most other Musou games, as it certainly feels like Atlus/Sega really had their hands in this to feel like a Musou game, but kept the theme and fighting to still feel like a Persona game. All the Thieves had their own showtimes, combat arts, and everyone just felt different in all the right ways. \n\nLastly, the music BUMPS. Persona games have always nailed this, but GOTDAMN this game got the tunes perfect! Every city and the tunes that follow it work for the areas. Everything like coming into the jails, the song playing for the big moments like \"Daredevil\", the title song \"You are Stronger\" Much better than P5 originally, as some palaces didn't really have themes that fit them well. \n\nMy biggest complaint as of now, is the crashing. The game crashes a good amount during some loading screens. Wasn't enough to deter me from playing, since I save almost every time I go to the hideout, before I have to load to the next area, but I was very nervous during some cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, super fun game. I loved every minute of it, and it didn't super overstay its welcome like P5 did. P5R helped manage the time better, and this game, every moment felt impactful and kept me on my toes.\n\n10/10.

There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this.

Persona 5 Strikers for me was a great game all the way through. When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively.

It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3ff5ae9b25d45382a27b5da45df8d085", "author": "3ddc6e420eef5481a5162fd2e0370a87", "date": "2021-03-26", "hours": 139, "content": "Too slow, and the game stops every  5 seconds to give you tips on how to do the simplest things.

Action-based persona combat is crazy fun.\n- Easy to run - not super demanding but strangely doesn't perform well at native 4K on a 2080ti, but that might be a me thing\n- Classic super deep persona story, shorter but not in a bad way. Easily 40-60 hours for someone experienced in the genres, more if you're not.\n- Plenty of additional challenges like Merciless difficulty on NG+, tougher boss fights and others to keep me coming back for more.\n\nCons-\n- No Ultrawide Support - I can forgive this for Persona 4 golden since it's a port of an older Vita game, but this game is new, come on.\n- Locked to either 30 or 60fps - again, modern games shouldn't have hard FPS caps.\n- Depth of the combat system can make things unforgiving for newer players - allowing for tweaking of individual parts of the game's difficulty like Persona 4 Golden has would go a long way for some players.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f73ea17a877857a8b47af4e47b3c84f5", "author": "ca10b06ec10555cbb11c12b83d941387", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 2516, "content": "This Game is really a part 2 of Persona 5.

I also can't recommend that you buy this game unless you have played the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal because it is a direct sequel and it makes no effort to catch the player up to speed.\n\n\nPersona 5 Strikers' new characters (Zenkichi and Sophia) fit seamlessly into the original cast, both of these new additions bring something new to the table, invoking both memorable dialogue and continuities that tie the main story together. The main story of Persona 5 Strikers follows up on Vanilla P5, it takes place during the summer after the main protagonist returns to his hometown and he makes a return to Yongen-Jaya to meet up with his old friends, aiming to do something fun for the summer. Unfortunately, this time of tranquility only lasts for so long until they meet their new conflict, which I'll leave you to discover.\n\nIt's combat is both addicting and intriguing, drawing the player in with immense strategy and its upbeat persona-esque music engaging its player. It's entirely different from P5's turn based combat but retains its strategy in exploiting weaknesses and debuffing your enemies. \n\nThe only problems I have with P5S is that the dungeons sometimes force fights on you, and it's incredibly difficult to manage SP. Also, I think I had somewhere around 4-5 crashes along my playthrough, so it's important to save often.

Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more.

If so, Persona 5 Strikers is the game for you.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about the Persona series in general, or Persona 5 in particular, to enjoy Strikers. P5S is a musou-style beat-em-up/hack-and-slash free-for-all, so if you've ever played any of the Warriors games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors), you know exactly what this is. That's not to say it's bad; in fact, just the opposite. P5S had me smiling from start to finish because it was simply fun, a thing I had long forgotten video games could be. In a world full of roguelikes, open-world sandboxes, MMORPGs, and JRPGs, the Warriors games simply put you in a room with a hundred bad guys and let you mow them down with manic energy. If that's the sort of thing you find gratifying, you'll like P5S.\n\nThis game is set not too long after the events of Persona 5. The band gets back together for a wild summer tour of Japan, but their plans are interrupted when hearts start changing without any apparent cause. The authorities blame the Phantom Thieves, who are forced to investigate and clear their name. Along the way, they encounter a Lewis Carroll enthusiast, have a classic mix-up in a Japanese hot spring, meet a living AI, bury a cop in sand, nearly get pummeled to death by brainwashed islanders, and fight a giant...um...phallus in a chariot (I'm not even kidding).\n\nIn true Persona style, every fight is a bombastic and flashy beatdown. Whereas other musou games do not penalize direct approaches, P5S rewards you for ambushing enemies and getting in opening hits while traversing dungeons. P5S not only draws on the Warriors franchise for inspiration, but also feels at times like the investigation parts of Ace Attorney and the stealth parts of Metal Gear Solid, while bosses and their dungeons often feel inspired by NiGHTS into Dreams. Using the eponymous personas adds a Pokemon-style RPG element as you swap party members and their personas in and out to maximize attack effectiveness. It's a lot of fun and there's a lot of replay value, especially since the game rewards you for revisiting places you've already been to for additional bonuses. The soundtrack is continuously popping off with jazzy, funky melodies during fights that encourage you to do everything from blow party poppers in your enemies' faces to skateboarding into them at high speed.\n\nIf Strikers is the swan song for Persona 5, then it could not have hit a much higher note.

The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e9bdea48234a579d9a9e514dc674e4e3", "author": "f61a85289cb45153baa16df575dc4e96", "date": "2021-03-23", "hours": 1490, "content": "[h1] TLDR; Poor PC port that crashes and fails to utilize SSDs, hilariously bad/lazy writing (if you disliked P5's writing, this is worse), and satisfying-but-boring battle gameplay. [/h1]\n\n[b] Fair Warning [/b]: My playtime does not reflect the length of this game, and I have not finished it due to being utterly frustrated with my aforementioned issues.\n\nWhen this got announced for PC, I was pretty excited to get some more breadcrumbs of Persona on the platform, even if it were just a Warriors-style spinoff. However, the final product given has left a LOT to be desired.\n\nThe first thing you may notice, at least if you have the game installed on an SSD, is the straight up abysmal bootup and loading times. Like, at least couple MINUTES to load into the intro screens. This game is definitely not as demanding as the original P5, and that game takes no effort to load on a disk drive for a console that's already out the door. On top of that, the game will constantly freeze and crash on loading screens. I've had 4 crashes in 24 hours, and 2 of those came on the same exact loading screen. The devs, however, do have a beta branch out as of this writing in the hopes of diagnosing and fixing these crashes.\n\nThe second thing you may notice, is how the writing in this release is just straight up not good. Some characters fall further into their awful stereotypes set in the original game (Ryuji & Ann are Dumb & Dumber, Makoto is even more bland, etc.). The two new characters to the group are just straight up depth-less copies of previous Persona franchise characters ( [spoiler] Sophia is super cute but seems to have the same character conflict as Aigis from P3, and Zenkichi has an eerily similar backstory and conflict as Dojima from P4 [/spoiler] ). There's even a bathhouse scene taken straight from Persona 3, except with the interesting bits removed and replaced with a generic slapstick punchline. Some positives to point out, though: the slice-of-life moments in this game feels just as heartwarming as the original game, Morgana is much less annoying, and Haru has way much more character and plays a bigger role in this game than she ever did before.\n\nThe third thing you may notice, the battle gameplay in this game feels confusing at first, but actually feels really clean and satisfying once you grasp it! However that quickly goes away once you realize the gameplay is just: travel to this place, battle a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, defend Futaba against a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, battle a boss and a crowd of enemies to complete part of the level. Repeat about three times and that's an entire arc of this game in the simplest terms possible. The battle gameplay is honestly not that frustrating (except: [spoiler] the massively disappointing Shadow Joker boss battle with an outrageous change in normal gameplay that honestly feels like a dumb gimmick rather than a difficulty spike [/spoiler]). If you enjoy Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, you probably won't have any problems here.\n\nAll in all, this is a ridiculously disappointing game. It's clunky/broken at times, cringey even for Persona standards, and just boring, confusing, and frustrating overall.

Like, really easy. Throughout my entire playthrough, I pretty much exclusively stuck with Joker (for obvious reasons), Haru (for heat riser and the fact that killing enemies with her rocket launcher was funny), Sophia (because she had a great moveset), and Yusuke (though I switched him out with Zenkichi during the Kyoto jail). While they were hovering in the mid level 70s by the final boss, my other team members ended under level 60. When you had to split up and fight the meatballs on the towers, I had no trouble spamming their moves and made it out without a single person dying. Even when you get all the meatballs and Joker has to kill EMMA, I just spammed Maeigaon and killed it without taking any damage. Honestly the Archangel in the room right before EMMA was more challenging in my opinion. The hardest boss of the entire game was Shadow Joker, and that's only because you do such little damage to him. I only got out of that boss fight by spamming health and sp healing items and wailing on him for a solid 10 minutes. Finally, I want to bring attention to Zenkichi. He absolutely stole the show in the entire game. There was so much passion that went into his performance, and, when paired with the writing of his character, made him the best part of the entire game. Also, as a temporary musical nerd, seeing Valjean appear in the awakening scene was an out of body popoff experience. The portrayal of Valjean as a persona was perfect (it even had the 24601 on his chest). But seeing Valjean specifically as the persona of Zenkichi was the most incredible thing because Valjean fits so perfectly with Zenkichi's character.

I have watched a bit of Persona 5, but that was it. I also haven't watched any content to P5Strikers, or better, P5Scramble. This is why I was surprised that it was a Hack-n-slash game, however, it works really well with the setting. And the story, oh boy, good characters, good plot and overall a great experience. Every character has its onw playstyle, be it the allrounder Joker who has really save moves, Ryuji who has massive burst-options that leave him wide open for attacks or Makoto or Morgana who specialize in buffing and healing their teammates. If you like the Persone-style and look for a good hack-n-slash, play this, it's like a 40-hour game and worth every single cent. The only downside to this game is its instability, it sometime crashes, not often, but often enough for you to start saving all the time, however, you can't save during cutscenes or textboxes, you have to wait till cutscenes are over and just pray. If there is a hot-fix, ill give it a perfect score of 10/10, but till now it is a 9.5/10.\nMusic is, as expected from the Persona-games, great.

Honestly, Despite what was said by the devs, I don't think this is too much fun for most people who haven't played the original P5 or Royal. Consider playing P5 before this to really get the most out of it. PS3's are pretty cheap nowadays, and if not it's pretty stable on RPCS3 *wink*. If you've played P5, It's an easy 10/10. If not please play P5 and then come here. If there's really no way for you to play P5 then maybe hold out for a sale cause the combat's still fun but honestly this game is more fun if you already love the cast. It goes down to like a 6/10 if you don't know the cast and past events. It doesn't spoil anything from P5 too big and you can still switch up the order but it's not recommended.\nUnlike this game.

Graphics for the game even on the max graphics settings are OK at best. The models in persona 5 are so much more crisp while the models in persona 5 strikers are blurry and hard to look at when far away. After playing persona 5, I have to admit that the characters have gotten stale for me. All of the arcs that the characters went through in persona 5 are pretty much just reused in this game, making it seem very lazy to say the least. A character that really grinds my gears is Sophia. Her character development is pretty much a sh*tty version of a certain someones character development in persona 3. No social links is also a real bummer. It was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed persona 5 and without them the game really feels like its missing something. Another thing I would like to point out is the fact that they make you go back into the real world and sit through two loading screens just to recover your SP. And its not like there's any incentive to go back to the real world. There's no social links, the day doesn't change, and the area your in remains exactly the same until you manage to drag yourself through the jail. Every time you try to do a persona attack it freezes time disrupting any natural flow the game could have had. As for the soundtrack, there's a few soundtracks I like and a few that are pretty terrible. The soundtrack I found most enjoyable was the soundtrack to the first jail, Love te Wonderland. Otherwise, it mostly goes downhill from there.

The new rock-infused tracks fit right in with the jazz music from the original game.\n- Sophia and Zenkichi are great additions to the cast, both having great characterizations and deep and complex backstories.\n- Gameplay is action-packed and hectic. Puts a spin in the typical Musou-formula. Each character have their own unique fighting styles, allowing for different experiences.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b] \n- The gameplay is rather repetitive. You'll be mowing down enemies again, again and again with no signs of stopping. \n- Bossfights are tedious and will test your patience. It will take quite a while to whittle down a boss's health to even half-health. Even mini-bosses aren't exempt from this. \n- Crashes and long loading times happen but are rare. Save often to prevent loss of progress.\n\nAll-in-all, as a Persona 5 fan, I love the game and enjoyed most of it. Love the story, the interactions between the crew, and the new characters.

When I first listened that we were going to have a new Persona experience with a new battle system which replace the turn based combat, it was really exciting news, but I also thought that it was going to be just a musou/warriors game with a persona art style, and hoo boy how I was wrong about that assumption.\n From the music to the art style,  and to the story and the combat, it really felt like a Persona 5 game. The implementation of some of the previous games combat system mechanics to this new musou/warriors style combat fitted perfectly. Each of the phantom thieves combat skills are unique and different from each other. About the music, they never cease to amaze me. Each of the music tracks are phenomenal and outstanding. If they release a Persona 5 Farming Simulation game with new music like this and the previous games, I\u00b4ll keep giving them my money.\n The visual novel story part is still in this game and very well adapted, and although the social link aspect of the previous game is replaced with this new bond level system, I think it adapts really well to the format of this game. The story and new characters in my opinion are very well written, and it is really easy to attach to them, as usual.\n If I had to criticize something, perhaps it would be that some of the characters from the previous game are not in this one, either way, the main roaster is here. \nTo conclude, if you have previously played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, definitely you have to play this game without any doubt. I repeat, if you have not played those games, then go play them first. THIS IS A SEQUEL.

It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.

It feels super bad to play, especially if you are trying to do the constant backtracking side missions which just require you grind X enemy in Y dungeon Z times.\n\nAgain from the original game, abilities use HP/SP but unlike the original game there isnt a ticking clock that makes you want to get as far through the palace as possible in one go.

It brings with it a compelling story, engaging combat and amazing music.  While technically a musou game, the game plays very much like a Persona game in most respects.  The majority of this review compares the differences between this game and Persona 5 and Musou games to give you a good sense of what you are getting yourself into.  \n\n[h1] Whats Changed [/h1]\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nCombat is by far the biggest difference between Persona 5 in this game.  The Combat has changed from a Turn Based System to an Active Time System, though it executes this spectacularly.  All of the iconic features of Persona are still present in this new combat system such as Weakness exploitation, All Out Attacks, and Stat/Ailment effects.  You also initiate combat just like you would in any other Persona game, by attacking an enemy on the field which sends you into a real time battle on the map.  \n\nWhile this is labeled as a Musou game, the only thing it really has in common with them is the number of enemies present on the screen usually consisting of a large number of trash mobs and a few enemies that actually pose a threat.  In addition, since it is Real Time, enemy attacks are now telegraphed and nearly all attacks are preventable by dodging out of the way or interrupting the enemy.  While this might be a bit hard to execute in trash mob fights with tons of enemies, this really shines in boss fights where there is one major threat to focus on.  \n\nOverall, this new Combat System is intertwined excellently with the Persona series, making you wonder why they have never done this before.  \n\n[b] Confidant System [/b]\n\nThe next big difference between this game and Persona 5 is the Confidant System, which was replaced with Bond Levels.  Unfortunately, this new system is quite limited as a whole, as it comprises only of party member interaction and lacks any NPCs to interact with and gain confidant levels with.  In addition, the time management system is all but gone as a result.  However, this new system still allows you to gain the benefits of the Confidant System by giving you Bond Exp with interactions, which you can use to buy perks very similar to what you would gain from Confidants.  \n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n \n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThe story is compelling as ever and while not quite as good as the main Persona series, still holds its own quite well, especially for a Musou game which typically don't have great stories. \n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nThe Music remains a strong point of the game and the series as a whole, with a number of remixed pieces from Persona 5 as well as plenty of new additions.  \n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\n[b] Crashes [/b]\n\nIn 50 hours of this game, I've had the game crash 5 times.  Each of these crashes occurred at either entering or exiting a dungeon, so often not much progress was lost.  However, since this game does not auto save, you have to be careful to save often to prevent losing significant progress.  \n\n[b] Lack of Prequel Explanation [/b] \n\nThis game absolutely expects you to have played Persona 5 prior to playing this game, as there is little explanation of character's backstories or prior events.  Often times, the game references major plot points of the previous game but does nothing to even mention what happened, leaving people who haven't played the previous game confused.  While normally not too much of a problem, it is not even possible to play Persona 5 on Steam as of this review.  \n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is an extremely strong spinoff of Persona 5 with compelling gameplay and story.  However, it lacks some of the major features that some Persona fans love so much and also requires you to have played the first game in order to properly enjoy the story.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9181504c6fc154f4913e020570cf796e", "author": "f4a47e9bed2150eba6197e263d428ee6", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 1948, "content": "Yes yes.

It continues the story of P5 in a similar, yet new way and continues to build the characters of P5.\n\nI found the gameplay very enjoyable, with it's unconventional turn-based RPG mechanics mixed in with the action gameplay. The action felt just right, you're able to dash around and attack just like in devil may cry but at the push of a button every stops and it becomes much more like a turn based rpg.\nI don't think they could have implemented this much better, so kudos.\n\nJust like the original the soundtrack is great. I personally prefer it to the original P5, but this is just my style of music. They even added in some Remixes of the original games music.\n\nLastly the story. I find it very good. It has been streamlined with story progression now being tied to your in-game progression, since there is no calendar system. I'm sure it would have been nice to see all characters from P5 return, but think it's better this way. The new additions fit in well too (mostly).\nThe real crime with the story of this game is a PC and switch exclusive problem. The original games aren't on these platforms and therefore many people are most likely going to be out of the loop when starting the game. Therefore they may miss some of the more subtle things, not understand everything or just not care. \n\nIn terms of the port, I did not have any big issues. Some framedrops when things got heated. I did have a few crashes, but only about six or seven in 70+ hours of playtime. Sidenote: This was also within the first two weeks of the games release. I have not tried 1.02 but I assume that is even better. \n\nOverall I recommend this game. It's really great. My biggest issue with it is that the NG+ difficulty might as well be called BS mode, so yeah. Great game. Worth your money.\n...\nBut there's a catch.\nI recommend you at least have basic knowledge of the previous game. I got through just fine knowing the base plot of the P5 and having watched the anime(yes the anime does cover most of the important things).

As usual from P5 the presentation in terms of audio and voice acting as well as the visual presentation is crisp and to an really high standard. \n\nThe gameplay is that of a warriors game though with the RPG elements of persona fitting in in a really natural way. If you don't like the gameplay of other warriors games then you probably wont enjoy this one, though if you want more of the P5 cast and story then i can still recommend playing on easy mode and it may surprise you.\n\nI can make that recommendation since this is one of the best warriors style games out there. All of the characters are fun to play and the combat is so satisfying, it tones down a lot of the warriors series main features to allow for the new content but that rounds off the experience really well to make for a game thats just fun to play.\n\nTLDR\n\nIf you liked the base P5 or are a fan of good warriors games then give this a go. If you don't like the genre then perhaps its worth skipping.

I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "559e81486b13567795b7016d8aa7a8e1", "author": "d7eefeb7dfed5f3290c28e91647fd6e3", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 2604, "content": "Actually crying rn......

Once I started playing, I'll admit a part of me wasn't totally sold on the concept as a whole yet. I had never played a Musuo/Dynasty Warriors game before but knew that I had to see what the next chapter for the Phantom Thieves had in store for us. Sure enough, the further I progressed, the more the game grew on me and the more I bought into the transition Persona 5 went through to become a game like this. In reality, the essence of what makes Persona 5 such a compelling and lovable game was really what shined through in the end. The cast was full of life, love, fantastic personalities and unforgettable moments. Every character had moments that really let them take center stage and remind us all of what it means to overcome our own struggles and once again stand up on our own two feet. Personally, I wan't to give a special shout out to Haru, who was the final character to join the team in Persona 5. One of the things I wished we had in P5 was more time to spend with Haru and more opportunities for her to shine and that is exactly was Strikers gives us. This goes for all characters as well. I enjoyed getting to tag along with the Phantom Thieves for another journey through the human heart that resulted in some strong and powerful character moments that empowered the story to really hit home for myself and I'm sure for plenty of people, especially after everything we've been through and are still going through with COVID. It's crazy to think how towards the beginning of the pandemic we were graced with Persona 5 Royal and now a year later, we're given a worthwhile next chapter for the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. A few things to touch on before wrapping this up.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nThe entire Persona series is known for its exceptional soundtracks and Strikers is no slouch in that department. Whether its the remixes of classic P5 tunes or the newcomers to the party making you stop what you're doing and groove in your chair, this game has no shortage of tunes for all manor of situations to aid you in your Phantom Thief duties! I plan on adding this soundtrack to my collection of Persona tunes that I already listen to on a daily basis.\n\n[h1] Crashes [/h1]\nThroughout my roughly 45 hours of game time, I had 3 total crashes happen while playing on PC. Thankfully, none of these crashes happened at crucial moments but it is something I've seen people write about in other reviews so make sure to save as often as possible!\n\n[h1] Story Continuation from Persona 5 [/h1]\nWhile ultimately not super important for the overall story, this game definitely assumes that you have played P5 before and are familiar with it's story so be mindful if you haven't played P5 before and are considering getting this game!\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nAny opportunity to team back up with the Phantom Thieves is easily one worth taking and Strikers does a great job delivering on a worthy sequel to what was already my favorite game of all time. Hopefully the overwhelming amount of positive feedback will encourage Atlus to keep releasing Persona games on steam since its clear that the Phandom, old and new, are eager for more! P5 fans will adore this game but ultimately, any fans of good storytelling and meaningful character development will fall in love just as easily!

This is instead a look at the game from a series perspective, so there may be other reviews more suited to your taste if this is not what you're looking for. I am not including a TL:DR because the review is a little scatterbrained despite it's length. If this helps even one person then I'm glad.\n\nIn many ways, Persona 5 Strikers is like a sequel to Persona 5. This isn't an original statement, as many describe the game this way, but the fact that it can be described as a sequel speaks volumes for one simple reason: P5S is just a spinoff. Atlus, along with the other studio that helped produced this work, were so bold as to mix ideas from the long-standing Persona/SMT with combat likened to Nier:Automata and Devil May Cry. It's very well done; the aesthetic that makes 5 stand out is still present here, and it is very faithful to the original game. I wouldn't say that it follows up perfectly after the release of Persona 5 Royal, (because this game released in Japan about a month before Royal went worldwide) so don't expect any of the characters/content from Royal here. I will say that a lot of the ideas for Royal were taken from this game, such as the thought process behind the Showtime! mechanic, so if you're familiar with some of the more recognizable content they added in Royal which was not present in the base Persona 5, you'll be glad to find it here. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers does contain some slight spoilers for Persona 5, so be warned if you haven't experienced 5 that there may be some things that are present here which could surprise you. I want to mention one key aspect that this game made me constantly think about though: the only thing holding Persona 5 Strikers, a SPINOFF title, from feeling like a main series game, was the lack of any confidant/social link mechanic. While this is disappointing, the fact that this can even be considered a downside should speak volumes for the game itself. There are only two instances in the game where any activity related to hanging out with a friend from the confidant/social link mechanics in other Persona games exist here. However, it should be considered greatly that following the events from Persona 5, you should not even need a confidant/social link bond with the characters in this game, considering that aside from the two new additions, you've already met and experienced hardship as well as friendship with every other character as the Phantom Thieves. \n\nAnother major advantage this game has is replayability and content. In your first playthrough, if you are even just a little adventurous, you will likely fuse most of the personas and have done just about all of the unique mini bosses present. Although, unlike in base 5 and Royal, the hardest difficulty for this game is locked behind a first completion of the game and then the completion of the post-game content. Let me say that if you're like me, and want a challenge from a game, the hard difficulty from a generic playthrough provides more difficulty than Persona 5/Royal's hardest difficulty. The hardest difficulty in this game is much, much more difficult than that. So trust me when I say that this game has enough content and replayability value, especially for those who want the challenge and unique achievements you can only gain through a merciless NG+ run. \n\nAs a final statement for this review, which has been all over the place, there is one more thing I want to mention. Fans of Persona 5 love the game for a lot of reasons; it's not a huge stretch to say it's a masterpiece in it's very flooded genre, which happens to be one of my favorite game genres. In my (and many others) experience, the music for Persona 5 is the one of the best parts of the whole experience. I am especially happy to say that the new music found in Persona 5 Strikers, be it the new battle themes and remixes of old battle themes or the background/tone setting music, is fan-fu**in-tastic. My personal favorite songs are \"Crossover\" and \"Counter Strike\", so be sure to check them out if you love the music but aren't sure about getting the game. Thanks to anyone who happened to read through this, and sorry for not having a TL:DR. If this helps even one person make the decision either to or not to buy the game, then that is enough for me.

This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6fb797a47edc5d9f93b0458e9c097567", "author": "fc53dc3c245a5cc099b4293d0ef06f60", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 4140, "content": "Fun game\nBad port", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6782ff0c884c589f8128d99e6405e5fc", "author": "a1f7a8cc6eb9597d9cbc7a5067574ba1", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 5379, "content": "Always been a fan of the of persona and while easier this was still alot of fun and great story from my opinion", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "58db4389bec3592daba31f3442496589", "author": "70b50b97a745531286b6032ae58ba311", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 2514, "content": "Okay, so for a PC port this was really good. \nMy only problem with the game itself: \nThe one major problem I had was the game randomly crashing, which was a rare occurrence ( happened only like 2-3 times in the 60+ hours i've played) so as long as you've saved regularly, it shouldn't be a problem. What I can't quite figure out is why it crashed? One of the times it happened I was just walking from one area of the real world to another, it wasn't even if a particularly crowded area with a lot of NPC's. The first time it happened it happened during a dialogue scene (the one in the attic towards the start of the game), which should be even less likely because it wasn't even loading anything at the time. Of course, I am hyping this up to be more of a problem then it actual is, and there is a chance that it may just be something my computer is doing. \n\nstory wise:\nHonestly, I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. This is a sequel game, if you played the original, you'll like this one, if you haven't you'd probably find a lot of the character beats uninteresting. The sole exception to that is the two new thieves, one of which is just adorable and the other of which is one of the funniest characters in any video games I have ever played.  Also, keep in mind that this game is a lot shorter then the original, which to be fair was a long game, but even beyond time spent, the first couple of dungeons were fillery, not bad, just not particularly important. I still had fun with it though.\n\nGame play:\nNo, it is not turn based, and yes the new combat can take a little bit to get used to, but its fun in its own way and I really enjoyed it and it makes this game feel like its own distinct thing and not just Persona 5 expect smaller and a tacked on story.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3cb35d512f6d5072bebc16d9a72db379", "author": "c77e1ea2aa0355be8db77b55a208ba6e", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 944, "content": "Good mix of a musou game and persona elements.

Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game.

I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse.

New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything.

By no means is it a cheap spinoff.

Once again, Atlus outdid themselves in making the party feel like a tight-knit group of friends, and even gave some much needed character development to those left hanging from the original. (looking at you, Haru, Ann, and Yusuke)\n\nPersonally, the shift to a Dynasty Warriors type real-time combat system is... fine. It doesn't do anything special for me, and honestly with most boss/miniboss fights it just devolves into spamming the same couple skills until you can't anymore. That said, the translation from a turn-based JRPG to real-time action was done very well, I just personally would prefer the incredible innovations on the turn-based JRPG formula that the original games provided.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game is sublime. Much like Persona 5 itself, the game just bleeds style, on everything from the animations to the menu UI. The music is also just exceptional, especially since it takes some of the best tracks from Persona 5 and gives them some new, almost metal, life.\n\nI did have some issues with random crashes between loads (running an i9-9900k and a 1070ti for reference), so make sure you save often, but they maybe happened four or five times in my fourty or so hours, and would in no way detract from the shining recommendation that I can give for this game.\n\nMakoto best girl", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a9d4b3cfb6e95d7f92341aa2886abea2", "author": "8458655017b25c8ba6e1601f8e064b83", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 4319, "content": "Bought the Deluxe edition for the early access. 10/10 Would spend that extra money again.

This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point.

SCORE: 7/10 Only recommend to fans, wait for Persona 5 for newbies.\n\nEvery review so far focuses on meme-like quotes or one thing that happens in the game. So, I'll tell you whats really in the game. The gameplay is more like Kingdom Hearts but with bigger mobs (not big mobs like Hyrule Warriors). It still retains Persona abilities and fusion but the fusion has been simplified from other entries. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and you have a fair bit of strategy to put into every fight especially the boss fights. The bosses alone will give you the sweatiest palms as they are harder than any of the Persona games by far. What I dislike about the game is its story. The Phantom Thieves are compelled to feel empathy for the antagonist of each city you go to. The writing feels very shallow even more so that in Persona 5. Also its been 20+ hrs for me and the game is still constantly holding my hand while traversing thru the maps. Like come on, don't insult my intelligence. And yes unfortunately the game is prone to crashing and it happens more often while transitioning to a new area. It becomes incredibly frustrating after you defeat an annoying boss and then the game crashes making you restart that fight. It's definitely worth $60 for returning Phantom Thieves but if this is your first Persona game I would wait until Atlus fixes the crashes and the game goes on sale for $40 or below.

The tl;dr is that the gameplay is fun, there's a lot of content and there's a ton of depth in the game's fusion/Persona mechanics. But I can't recommend this game to newcomers and maybe even veterans for a simple issue; the game is horribly optimized. I'm running a 1650 and Ryzen 5 4600; not stellar components but respectable nonetheless. This game barely runs at 60 on mid/high settings at 900p. Its hilarrious just how poorly the game runs but even that isn't a dealbreaker. I wish the game ran better but I can handle a poorly optimized game as long as its stable but hoo boy is this game not stable. I'm around halfway through Strikers and I have had five separate crashes in my 20 hour playtime. Think about it, that's a crash every 4 hours.

For me, it was the first of the series that I bought and played on the recommendation of a close friend. I grew to love Persona 5 so much that I had ended up playing the game over and over, committing all I could to memory. I wanted to observe every nuance of what made Persona 5 the game it was, or rather is. I even bought the Persona 5 Royal version and fell in love all over again. When I first saw Persona 5 Strikers I immediately looked into it, like any fan would. The trailer video was encaptivating, but I hesitated to buy. The completely overhauled battle system worried me. The original Persona 5 battle system encompassed a long time familiar style of RPG turn-based battles most gamers of the genre are familiar with. Additionally, the time management aspect coupled with building confidants added an endearing allure. Strikers, a now hack & slash version, redesigned combat from the ground up. Personally, I avoid games like this because I recognize my lack of ability and commitment to build the skills necessary to dominate the battlefield. The realization that I may not enjoy this game disheartened me for the longest time. Many times I skipped passed Strikers in the Steam store. However, maybe due to overwhelming boredom, I began perusing the comments of players who had played the game. I can't remember the poster, but they shared the same concern as my own. After reading it, I decided that even if I didn't love the game, that I loved the Persona franchise so much that I'd support it regardless. On that note...\n\nUSE THE GAMEPAD CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME! Standard keyboard setup is not sufficient for this game.\n\nInitially, I disliked combat, and I disliked the feeling of having my Persona 5 world condensed into the shell of an \"efficient game\". What I mean is the play style and aspects of play seemed to have been developed in a way that screams \"instant satisfaction\". Not that it's a bad thing. It just seemed hollow in comparison to its predecessor. I was starting to feel a disconnect to the series. \"I guess they're just trying to monetize on the success of the story.\" The thought spoke loudly in my head. As I started to progress into the game, it was clear that my preconceived notions were wrong.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, albeit different from Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, is still an amazing game. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts still managed to steal this skeptical heart of mine. Though I find the battle system complex and difficult to use well, it still offers a new and fun perspective. If you've played Persona 5 or Royal, this game is guaranteed to throw you for a loop. But don't give up. If you're a true Phantom Thief, you'll rise to the challenge and steal the love for this game you once had. Give it a chance.

The other major thing that some will harp on is the lack of the \"social sim\" aspect, it's more as a group collective this time around instead of juggling your time between school, 1 on 1s and the metaverse, you tackle things as a team from start to finish. I don't believe that to be a drawback and fits in with the more fast paced nature of Strikers.\n\nThroughly fun game and would recommend to any Persona fan.

The animations for All Out Attacks aren't quite as flashy, the game doesn't have as much meat to it, there are a lot of quality of life features missing, and much fewer voice clips for common actions like buying, selling, or aiming a gun (meaning that you're going to hear the exact same line spoken over and over and over again). However, saying that Strikers isn't as good as P5 or Royal is like saying an uncut diamond isn't as good as a 24-karat gold ring; in either case, what you have is still pretty damn good. \n\nIf you've never played P5 before, don't be mistaken into thinking you can just leap into this game. It picks up after the events of the previous game and does very little to backtrack over who characters are or what events happened, which is great for returning fans since they can just right back into the action, but newcomers will be left totally lost. There is probably still an enjoyable story here for newbies, but he finer points will be lost--and considering just how important story is to the Persona series--it is a large thing to miss out on. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever return to this game now that I've beaten it. I honestly prefer the turn-based RPG battles of normal P5, and Royal is just filled with so much better content and quality-of-life features that I've grown so accustomed to that, should I ever feel the urge to jump back into Persona, I think I'll be popping in Royal long before Strikers. \n\nAll that said, however, this was still a damn fun game and I'm glad I played it.

The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it.

It is a great spin-off that actually adds something to the characters' stories from the last game.

The game really does assume that you know what happened previously and only does a bit of background knowledge.\n\nAnother caveat, this game is NOT turn-based like the other Persona games.  Now, while I prefer turn-based combat, this games combat is extremely fun.  It is not just random button mashing, but instead a bit more strategy needs to be put into each fight no matter the difficulty.  I played the whole game on hard and I will say that at the start it will kick your ass if you have no experience playing musou games.  However, once you start to understand the combat, the personas, each character, and the skills then the game becomes a lot more easier (still not easy, but you will have better knowledge into the combat).\n\nStory-wise, this game is extremely strong much like Persona 5/Royal.  Is it as good a story?  No, but then again the length of the game is like one half that of the normal games.  I will not write any spoilers, but I did enjoy the story with each character still being the same, but growing a bit.  It is such a good feeling to see the Phantom Thieves interacting with one another, in both the happy scenes and the more serious ones too.  The addition of some new characters was something that I was worried about, but I think they handled it remarkably well.  They both have interesting backgrounds, interactions, and actually important to the story.  \n\nJust one last mention, the music is fantastic again.  It sounds just like Persona 5 which I loved back when I played it and I still love it now.\n\nIssues I had with the game.  I see that people have struggled with crashes and I will say that I only crashed once and thankfully I had saved like a minute prior.  But, I do think that each person's game will act differently so make sure to save as much as possible!  The other issue I had with this game is just the lack of side stuff to do with the Phantom Thieves like what was possible in the previous versions.  I did not expect nearly as much as the last games, but I think there could have been more interesting \"requests\" with the members.\n\nI highly recommend this game!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74d0f84d475a50d18067c6a19d94334b", "author": "79ea15bf7d97518bb9638bc8e11f0c57", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 5608, "content": "SUPER RECOMMENDED!!

Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server.

The characters and story all felt extremely bland to me, with its supposed themes being executed with the bare minimum of effort placed into it. Most characters were bland and some were even annoying. Including the wasted potential of the ideas the game presented, in the end it just left me unsatisfied. The only saving grace of the original game to me was the gameplay, the style, and a few tracks of the ost.\n\nThis game however [b] is not [/b] the original Persona 5 and it really shows, not just with its gameplay, but with its genuine thought and care placed into its characters and plot with only one minor hiccup being the obvious twist. Besides that this game blows the original P5 out of the park with everything it has to offer.\nThe game's new characters Zenkichi and Sophia are some of the best persona characters I've ever gotten to experience, Sophia specifically now being my all time favorite with her fun personality and amazing growth as a person, or in her case an AI. Learning about emotions as the story progresses and learning what it means to have a heart. Zenkichi isn't too far behind her though, being the first adult of the Phantom Thieves does bring in some fun banter between him and them all, usually with him being called \"Gramps\" and teased for being a bit of a dork. Him being part of the police as well adds some more chemistry with the Thieves bringing in a pretty fun dynamic between them reminding them they can't go and break the law for their shenanigans. Both of them make for amazing additions to an already set in stone team.\nThe themes presented with its villains really struck a cord with me this time around actually making me feel some emotion on my part. A majority of them even relate with some of the main characters own lives which makes for really interesting lines of dialogue where they reflect on it and how it must've affected the villains' thoughts.\nThe gameplay is absolutely outstanding with it's fast based combat, being similar to a warriors game of course it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I really did enjoy it. Every characters moveset felt unique, fun, and extremely flashy. All of which just makes the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThere are negatives of course, this game may be close to a perfect 10 but there are a few glaring issues with the game.\nCrashes and soft locks aren't a common occurrence but they really shouldn't be happening in the first place considering how it never happens on consoles, I may have been able to get used to it but some people won't.\nThe way fusions work in this game feel incredibly tedious requiring incredibly low level personas to be at levels like 40 and 50 to create the fusion, which later on is a lot easier but in the beginning is absolutely annoying.\n\nBesides those issues however I really think this is the best Persona game in the series. Definitely not a jump on point for newcomers, but I really recommend it if you're already into persona and wanting a fun action game. It certainly made this P4 die hard quite happy.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "269a887861f85bef87ff1bb11fc76ec5", "author": "2f54283a10b6580a9acbd6c95044dece", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3876, "content": "Such great, many funs. 10/10 would take to dinner... wow.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1dee853623375305905d77bb0cfcb417", "author": "6f29e059efee5ea38a539bb1f51050cd", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 902, "content": "More cut scenes than combat but worth it to hear Ryuuji swear", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09f64771202755878f5d6330c06280a1", "author": "cc1ca02bd40c5ed9beb56d351ffb2071", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3381, "content": "T", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "02ff2011e034550090ed562f9ad13ef2", "author": "4e827c04088853b08b9c69d61deffbac", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 40, "content": "good game just that they need to make it so I can fullscreen and the game won't crash\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "00481054fda051c88be53e870828f373", "author": "e4b5bf0b155f5f689fc8420698c9b5f4", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 188, "content": "(The game crashing has been fixed on my end, make sure to check ur community updates to get the beta code for the hotfix)\nThe gameplay here is FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC the story being a sequel to P5 is awesome.\n HOWEVER this game is B R O K E N, graphical stuff plus random crashes has me recommending the game after it's fixed and not a second before.\n(the game is only manual saves, which if not obsessively saving will result in multiple hours worth of progress just being yeeted to the infinite due to some dumbass crash.)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f43f07840d355fa5a2322c693354bab5", "author": "89e7413d94125bbab4bc823d98b89638", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 3047, "content": "I definitely enjoyed this game, but I do have a few bones to pick. Overall? I love it, and definitely recommend it. But I also can't imagine enjoying it anywhere near as much if I hadn't played the prequel.\n\nLoved:\n\n- The travelling by camper van premise. And you can still decorate inside - Nice touch.\n\n- Yusuke. No lie, he's my favourite character. So weird, and usually the one to make me crack a smile or laugh.\n\n- Graphic style. Easy on the eyes!\n\n- Characters, in general. You definitely get a good dose of each of their personalities in the game, which is great.\n\n- Game mechanics. I'm fine with turn-based games, as Persona has been until now, but real time is definitely so much more fun. You can use also use objects in the environment to pull off different moves. Not novel or anything, but definitely makes the battles more dynamic. \n\n- The voice acting. I usually listen to the original voices over the English voices because the latter often bothers me. But here? The voice actors nailed it. Lots of emotion, tone, and personality. That said, I suggest changing the audio configuration ASAP in game, as I find of the base levels of background volume to voice volume to be imbalanced, and sometimes I could not hear the voices over the background music.\n\n- Music was great, as always (okinawa jail bgm is one of my favourites in the game). The upbeat and catchy songs were also very fitting. Having some of the music and songs from P5 was a nice touch/connection, as well.\n\nBones to pick:\n\n- Game length. I did everything possible in about 43 hours in my first run, and I took my time. It's action and content packed with not too many extras, but I had expected there to be a good 20 more hours (including extras) considering its predecessors. I ended up cursing the whole \"only 1 month of summer vacation\" standard of Japan as the reason why the game had to be \"short\".\n\n- Linear/simple story. Doesn't usually bother me, but having played other persona games, it's simple by comparison.\n\n- Personas. So many were cut out in this game - and Persona 5 already had a bunch cut from Persona 4...I had been looking forward to discovering them, seeing how they'd be animated and going to town with them, but there are definitely far fewer.\n\n- Less sneaking around. Ambushing enemies from behind sofas, tables, corners etc in P5 had been fun. In this game it's mostly ambushing from above in some form - nice add-on, but I don't think it should have replaced the other ambush methods. I had also anticipated ambushing from actual shadows/blind spots, which happens in P5, but there wasn't really any of that in this game. It also bothered me that you could perch on some things but not others - e.g. traffic poles (Shibuya arc), but not the concrete lanterns/posts, or even low rooftops (Kyoto arc)? Couldn't see the logic behind that. Also a little disappointed that you couldn't ambush from trees. I guess because of the \"phantom dash\" distance you could leap to various perches, it seems the potential for the context was too limiting.\n\n- I do miss the one on one, sometimes one on two, bonding scenarios from P5. You get a handful of bonding chances in Strikers, but not many. Instead it focuses on group bonding, which shows how tight the Phantom Thieves group is. \n\nPetty disappointments:\n\n- Protagonist has virtually no role this game. Kinda just there to watch his friends be the ones to help/inspire others this time. Would have been nice if each character had their own arc, in addition to the group dynamic, like P5 did.\n\n- Protagonist wears his glasses all game. I was hoping I could take them off...As far as what's been suggested he doesn't even need them, anyway!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ee426b78d2ed5e86ad1e9ed485b690ba", "author": "db3d26e60bec574e8b47420e31586bc2", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 1512, "content": "If you are a fan of original P5 or Royal, I'd highly recommend this, it doesn't have any of the Royal characters in it but still a very solid and fun game!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e199f487f45d5eb7b1f4d6387a6184bf", "author": "bac0f1d1408b5364b98de84c0b14bbb1", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 2800, "content": "An enjoyable sequel to Persona 5.

I noticed it really only happened when I used a wireless controller, but once I switched to a wired connection I didn't notice any issues. Save frequently just in case that's not the reason.

I was looking forward to playing it for the past couple of months and it did not disappoint in the least.  I did play Persona 5 a while ago so I know everyone well and it's really cool that they made this so that we can see them again.  Everyone is just as cool as they were before and there are a couple new characters who are also very cool.  The voice actors are all very good (I use the Japanese).  The graphics are also very good.  It's very shiny and bright.  Overall, I will give this game an A+++++.  I will keep at it until I get everything and then I'll probably start over.  I think it's nice that they give you the option to select your difficulty level.  Next time I play, I will try hard mode.

I'm on a gaming laptop and can run it at around 1.5 resolution, max graphical settings, 60 frames non combat(btw max cap is 60, so wait till someone mods it for that to change) which lowers to 40 in hectic combat(which I never actually notice, unless i'm looking at my fps number). I say all this is because between each area it's about 10-20 seconds. Which isn't short enough to ignore nor long enough to alt tab. This is my biggest complaint with the game and that's saying a lot. \n\nAll i can say is compared to muso games this is probably the best(although i've heard hyrule warriors was made by the same studio so maybe that's just as good) in every department.\n\nI would recommend buying this game at full price even if not a persona fan. \n\nNot a giant downside to me but the social life aspect is toned down a lot. P5R was I'd say 25 percent social life, 60 percent game, and 15 percent cutscene, this is 65 percent game, 25 percent cutscene, and 10 percent social life", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7d2f111d0b7956ae8631fe14fbbad76b", "author": "8258db9ce1dd5aad9fd75967ccda5db7", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 268, "content": "decent game but a trash port, crashes alot.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7b2d02520df450fc82986e35c32f28e7", "author": "766b45d90142595cb06d9c6165d5010f", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 1817, "content": "team saya sudah level 70+ semua terus game nya udah mau tamat. persona saya udah ada satu yang level 99. saya gatau mau ngapain lagi. udah mau ujian saya malah grinding. dhla.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "71ee5f34c7af5df5b5c89c9a13ac7fb9", "author": "97b3cab791a25b83adc030cb6a01fc5e", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 279, "content": "They did great work on this game. It reflects off of Persona 5 and they still keep the Persona 3 vibe, style, and music like its other games. \n\nIf you are a big fan of Shin Megami Tensei, and the older Persona series, you will like this.\n\nAlthough the game's style is much different, and inspired by the types of fighting style games like\nHyrule Warriors Age of Calamity, and Dynasty Warriors.\n\nIts a mobby hack and slash game, so if you want a ton of action this is a much get. Its not a turn based\nRPG like the other titles but you still kick some ass.\n\nWhats great is that instead of just trying to remember a ton of moves, they have them shown\ndown at the bottom of the window of your game to show you what to press if you dont remember how to do\nsome moves. You can also look at the tutorials again in the Options Menu in case you missed something.\nInstead of mashing at the keys, its good to get to know your moves. If you dont you may lose much faster especially\nif you run into a mid boss or something nasty.\n\nIts got a ton of Story, good Music, it has its suspense moments, and comedy too. It has that Anime/Manga feel of it as well.\n\nIm not a reviewer snob (like yelpers) but just leaving an honest review, and its gameplay.\n\nI think the only thing i would complain about is that they dont leave an option to watch the cutscenes\nyou just completed. So if you want to see them again, you dont get to.\n\nI have the bonus content they dont provide any of the animations, only the behind the scenes of the production.\n\nOther than that its still a solid, and clean game.

Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series.

The only bad thing about it is there isn't more of it (it's still 40-60 hours, and it's all great). There's also no New Game+, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's patched in later as you can save your clear data.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best new games I've played in the last 5 years if not longer. If you've played Persona 5, you'll probably love it, and if you haven't, then what the hell are you waiting for?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7d94346b712957d394264345a860f689", "author": "b652febac4585d1f821cc345e45511f0", "date": "2021-03-10", "hours": 1075, "content": "Awesome follow up to the original game.

I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way. With new cast members thrown into the mix, it only strengthens the character line up within Persona 5's world. Certain characters however do end up boiling down to their singular trope such as Futaba being more egregious or Makoto doubling down on her motherly role within the group. \n\nOverall story was interesting enough to keep me wanted to see how it would progress. However, there were a few moments that felt repetitive in the game play when it came down to locations. Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes. Not just once or twice but multiple times. Personally, it crashed 15+ times but some friends have had it crash much more or much less.

Standalone, the most glaring thing is you're dropped straight in assuming you already understand Persona 5's plot. While I feel like you would enjoy the game regardless, I highly recommend visiting the first Persona 5 game. If you're in a pinch, watch a playthough or in the worst case scenario the anime (though not very well received.)\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI have had numerous crashes since the early release day and to my knowledge there is no fix yet, which is a little off-putting. If you do decide to get this game for PC, please practice good saving habits if only for this reason. Save as often as possible, as this game does *not* autosave. While I still enjoyed the experience overall, the crash issue made me wish I got it for console instead. There are also a few game-breaking bugs which you will have to avoid. For example, you cannot play in fullscreen or borderless windowed modes or the game will go into a black screen if you trigger a cutscene. You must play in windowed mode as far as  my experience has shown me.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay combines aspects of Persona 5's JRPG elements and combat, with musou mechanics you're probably familiar with most \"Warriors\" games. While it has its flaws, I never found myself bored. Fights felt interesting, though sometimes downright easy playing on \"Normal.\"\n\nAs a note to Atlus, you've got to be more timely with bug-fixes and more courteous to your PC audience if you want to keep going with this PC release approach. At the very least keep some sort of communication with the player base acknowledging the issues.\n\nSTORY:\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of the original Persona 5. It does not take into consideration your past romance(s?) or confidants, nor can I say it makes any clear reference to the events of Persona 5 Royal. You may notice some themes being reused in the first few levels of the game that are similar to Persona 5's palace themes. I will say, however, that they are distinct enough to not feel like a rehash. The antagonists feel unique, and contrast heavily from the precursor of this game. \n\nOverall, without giving anything away, while the writing is definitely not as good as before it's pleasant for those already familiar with the first game, showing strong character growth in contrast and an interesting new evil to take on. I personally believe this is a worthy sequel story-wise.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nI'm hoping the glitches are resolved for the PC release at some point. That said, I can comfortably recommend this game to people who are itching for more of the Phantom Thieves adventures, those looking to beat up massive hordes of shadows, or even if you're really weird and want to get introduced to Persona 5 with this game! I'm giving the game a thumbs up, but begrudgingly so in light of the current state of the PC release. But for my purposes, this game was worth the occasional crash and being forced to play in Windowed mode.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f555cf9e1385e21aa9f4dcea6e8e08a", "author": "be2fe9cecdfe5f83a7f308134396ed16", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 3215, "content": "This da best game on steam.\n\nRoyal on steam please, ill give kidneys for that game.\n\nPlay it after base persona 5, this bangs.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6b17d21cfb095f2b84e21089044aa588", "author": "e335ab9ff661551fb0aa358af053934a", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 1600, "content": "This game is great.

Get this.  Never played Persona 5?  Probably not for you.\n\nIf you've played Persona 5 and are on the fence about this because of it being Dynasty Warriors combat, take the plunge.\n\nThe combat is actually way more Persona than I expected.  In fact, for difficult fights I spent way more time hitting the Persona button, exploiting weaknesses, switching characters to heal/buff, etc.  In any event, as someone who usually really doesn't care for DW, I found the combat in the game pretty enjoyable.  The dungeons were at least as interesting as anything P5 was doing, too.\n\nUnlike typical DW games, the draw here is the story.  This one is a direct story sequel to the Persona 5.  If you liked that story and want to just hang out with the dudes again on a road trip around Japan doing Phantom Thieves stuff, then play this game.  You don't get the time management social game from the mainline Persona games, but you get a full-fledged, consistent with Persona 5, sort of on-rails story.  It's really solid.\n\nOne other thing that I didn't really expect, the general presentation of the game is also pretty consistent with the quality of Persona 5.

This being said I won't be softening any criticisms below whats here is a genuine face value of the game.\n\nAnimation, story, and interaction\n-This game is purely more persona 5 with it's character interactions. Given there is no confidant system or romance options, so waifu wars don't work here, but if you enjoyed the casual phantom thief bits from persona 5 this is a treat.\n-The music is purely high quality stuff, mostly all of the new tracks written for this game sound great. From the first prison's music to the final bosses it's all persona standards, and even if you aren't a fan of it, the game allows any persona music to be the main soundtrack.\n-Most of the animations are pretty well done, primarily the new showtime special attacks are beautifully done, each character has their own unique animation matching their personality. Honestly Joker has the most basic sadly because of his many persona options.\n\nThe Gameplay    \n Perspective of a playthrough on hard first time using a ps4 controller via an xbox controller layout\n\nFrankly I love the combat style of this game, it advertises itself as being a hack in slash, which by technicality is true. Coming from a hard difficulty perspective, I entirely believe that hard is the best way for this game to be experienced. \nBasic attacks and combos --- Basic attacking is unique to each character however they all share similarities. Combos are all simple at face value being either   X-Y    X-X-Y     or   X-X-X-Y                 but they can get depth from stringing them together, but what makes the combo system unique is how each of those inputs will cast a persona skill, whether it be a buff, debuff, or skill. These combos likewise use no precious sp, so in longer fights they are instrumental so that joker doesn't develop magic dysfunction as the boss pulls out a second health bar. \n\nMore advanced unique movesets ---  each character has specially made attack animations and mechanics and I will attempt to list them here without any spoilers. Some overlap but that's to be expected\nJoker- has a basic dagger gun moveset based around getting quick persona combos\nRyuji- focuses on charged hits that deal incredible damage, and can prevent staggering with a self buff\nAnn- Can imbue her whip with fire that allows her to deal with an enemies weakness from basic attacks\nMorgana- simple normal moveset, becomes car for special moveset. nuff said\nYusuke- Is based around unique combo counts, where Y activates a parry frame, and if successful he can add more hits to a combo counter\nHaru- Purely aoe strength, her persona combo strikes are large and lingering and all of her hits are powerful\nMakota-buffs her large combo attacks with nuclear, uses johana to ride down enemies with X-X-X-Y\nFutaba has the same role to the point of redundancy. The largest change is the added support where she increases showtime gauges\n\nCounterstrikes\nNot only is this my favorite track in the game against japanese ironman lol, but it is a skill in the new bond system that I quite like. This skill means any last minute dodges allow the character to immediately retaliate with a persona attack. Get this skill immediately it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThief dash aka area hopscotch \n-dash to a piece of scenery and interact with it dealing damage of a certain type. Honestly I really like this system, I like the little differences in character the interactions show, and it gives the player more control over the terrain. All bosses use the interaction really neatly as well with the least creative being the final boss who I won't spoil\n\nOkay now time for the nitpicks\nThe slightly bad \n\nSpammed with tutorials at the beginning - LIKE DEAR GOD the first few hours of the game you won't escape these things. It's like they were stalking me waiting to pop out from a corner EXCUSE ME SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT BURN. Like they serve a purpose but if you already know how the status works from persona 5 you will get annoyed fast. Doesn't help that they give you messages about EVERY character when you switch to them, which playing all of them from the beginning, it gets irritating fast.\n\nThe game always has you fighting with 3 other ai controlled phantom thieves unless you take them off of your party, and I would discourage doing this. Usually the ai are protected from their own stupidity by generous I frames and resistance to attacks, and they seem to avoid using sp..........Unless they are healing\n               \nHOWEVER, some times the ai just get in your way, they will die like idiots and leave you fighting alone, just because the game didn't save them. Like for instance, and I'll avoid spoilers, but one boss creates stupid walls of lasers to hit you, and these things move incredibly slowly. I'd have to drop my controller on the floor to get hit by these things, but the ai will not avoid them. They don't understand that the back of the platform is the only safe spot so they stand there and get whacked. It's honestly infuriating.\n\n-So this is a genuine problem but a strange one. So this game lacks all interaction with side characters who weren't phantom thieves, so there is no takemi or iwai in this game which is already pretty sad. Instead their shops are combined into a shop Sophie runs from wherever the thieves are at that moment. Now breaking the disbelief that sitting in the middle of an island a delivery could get there in a matter of moments, this shop seems like a good way to get the thieves items from anywhere. The problem lies in the amount you can buy, as the amount is always from 1-4 of an item, including healing(I think the most is a 120 heal later in the game which you can get 4 of at a time). Throughout the game this isn't an issue, it works well in fact to stop you from skyrim healing through every fight, BUT AT THE END, there is a gauntlet of tough refights with bosses as well as dangerous shadows for the postgame content. This practically requires decent health resources as well as sp items, but the only way to restock this dumb shop is by spending time in the metaverse, but not just that winning fights. That means you have to run through an area killing everything several times over to get the heath resources needed to beat some of this tough fights. The shop also contains incredibly rare cooking items, specifically that POS coffee bean that is never there but is needed for 2 post game special recipes, so get to grinding that last area. I swear if the enemies in that last area weren't pushovers to a grenade launcher I would have lost my sanity\n\n-This game has no Satanael. None of the awakened personas from persona 5 are here, every single member of the main cast has their originals, Morgana still has gorro, Ryuji still has captain kid, Ann has Carmen, Haru, has M'lady etc. It's pretty mentally annoying especially since Morgana HAD to become max rank as a confidant, and thus had to have an evolved persona.\n\nOkay THE REALLY BAD\n-The game has a bug where it softlocks after a particular boss...... This did not affect me but it is worth noting\n-There can be infinite loading screens........This did not affect me\n-The game doesn't start for some people\n- And finally the most annoying one, this thing crashes randomly in loading screens, and it's painful and this one did affect me. I had to live in fear half the time because I had made significant progress, and a visit to Lavenzia could outright delete that time spent.

Instead of large scale battles you have fixed encounters as if you were exploring a palace in persona 5. The combat is supposed to be fast paced but a lot of the time you end up opening menus to cast spells or switch your persona.\n\nA lot of what you'd expect in a Persona game is here but parts of it feel empty and missing. You have most the systems you'd except like fusing and elemental weakness and resistances however there are no social links. In fact there's not much socializing at all in this game.\n\nThere's a bond meter with the Phantom Thieves as you play through the game and clear side quests but that's about it.

It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dc73029ec27c522b8e2c4595a49eb715", "author": "c7e57a35c45352ad9e5efd44cddb2937", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 3409, "content": "is a very good and long game (for 100%) that i haven't even scratched the surface of new game+ merciless mode due to insane yet rewarding game play", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "db08df4536b555d78a52ccbcdcd830ee", "author": "1dd527ac96365ffb8c8ce87ef3042159", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 452, "content": "This is the game all persona fans were waiting for.

However, having since played the PS4 version of the game I can confidently say it is an incredible game. A true sequel to the base version of Persona 5, P5S is an absolute perfect blend of both Dynasty Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, in a way that I have not seen from any other \"warriors\" type cross over game to date. \n\nThough the combat system has changed entirely to a hack and slash action RPG style game, it still manages to maintain a lot of the systems that made Persona 5 what it is, such as the baton pass, Persona fusion, elemental weaknesses, one mores and even adding Showtime attacks which mimic their Persona 5 Royal counterparts. On top of this, you still have the typical Persona gameplay of wandering about various parts of Japan and spending time with your buds, as you would expect, but this time without the time constraints. \n\nAnother aspect that thoroughly impressed me was the story, though it is \"just a crossover game\" it is not treated as such and given the full seriousness and treatment of a sequel to Persona 5. With a fully fleshed out story, two fantastic party members with their own story arc and all the character development from P5 that makes Morgana a bearable addition to the cast now! \n\nYou get the full on Persona experience and the full on Dynasty Warriors experience with this game, the best of both worlds with no shortage on either of them.

It's a fantastic follow up to vanilla Persona 5. And if you haven't had the chance to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then you can pretty much jump into this game semi-blind, there are a few things spoiled but nothing too major I'd say. I didn't think this game would be all that great when it was first announced but after playing it and beating it today, I can say it's a lot better than I anticipated. Especially as this is technically a spin-off. I can confidently say that this game is the best possible sequel to Persona 5 we could receive. Atlus and Koei Tecmo really out did themselves.\n\nThe combat/gameplay: Gone is the Confidant/Social Link system from previous main Persona games and in their stead comes a story progressed system. The game does not overload you with confidants and stats to raise (which in my opinion is a great thing!) as the game progresses with the story and doesn't move on until you're ready, so you can spend what would be considered two separate days in Persona 5 just grinding in the jails as Persona 5 Strikers will not move on until the next day until you're ready and have finished what you want for that day. Next are the Bond Skills. These essentially replace confidant abilities and offer so much variety in gameplay. You can invest your points into skills that: increase your health and sp (something I seriously recommend for later on in the game), allow you to crack open safes that contain decent loot, increase your physical and magical attacks, allow your allies to heal you from alignments, and more! These bond points are a welcomed feature in my eyes! Now for the big thing: the new combat system. I must say, I haven't played a warriors-styled game until now but I am pleasantly surprised with the results. Gone is the JRPG turn-based combat system. You now have to partake in essentially horde/wave battles, something I think fits the Persona series quite well. You get to wreak loads of havoc, unleashing powerful and swift attacks onto oncoming hoards of mindless shadows. I especially love how time freezes when you're using your personas, it gives you plenty of time to plan out your attacks and make sure you utilise the best skills possible. I really like the new combat system and honestly believe the Persona series should utilise this going forward. Showtime attacks are also a feature (I think I may prefer the Royal showtime attacks however), they don't do much damage initially to bosses later in the game, however there is a bond skill that increases the amount of damage that showtime attacks does (something I seriously recommend you invest your points in).\n\nNew Characters: I know for a fact I'm not the only one who wishes this game followed Royal's timeline rather than vanilla's, but the absence of Akechi and Sumire are made up for with the two new party members of this game: Sophia and Zenkichi. I can say without a doubt, these two characters are great additions, they're so comedic and powerful additions to the Phantom Thieves. If I'm being honest, I prefer how these two characters were handled and implemented into the story rather than how Atlus dropped the ball with Sumire in Royal. They flow really well into the story and their eventual arcs are intriguing all the way. Not to mention they provide a unique sense of freshness for the already established cast. All the characters work well off each other and you can tell they've grown even closer during Joker's six month absence. Sophia is a more cutesy addition whereas Zenkichi is the more comedic addition. As I have previously mentioned, both new characters are fantastic additions to the PT cast and I hope to see them return in an eventual Persona 5 Arena game or even another P5 related spin-off.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, no game is absolutely perfect, this game does have some striking (no pun intended) issues. The game crashed for me around three times in total, mainly during the end of the second jail, specifically when I had finished the trauma cell (so just be careful about that as you may experience this issue for yourself and lose some progress). Next is an issue where some of the keys decided to stop functioning. There is a simple fix for this issue: simply just press the windows key and go out the game and go right back in. Even though this was easy to fix, it was still a hindrance, especially as it happened during the final boss! Although this isn't an issue that has affected me, some people are reporting that some of the characters voice's differ in audio quality, I personally couldn't tell the difference and thought the audio sounded perfect for everyone. I do understand some people may be able to tell considering the voice lines were recorded at the actor's homes using a kit provided to them. But like I said, I couldn't tell the difference so it doesn't effect me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Finally, I bought the digital deluxe edition of this game so I could play it early, and my playtime ended in a whopping 60:04 hours. It took me a little longer than maybe some other players as I decided to really focus on the side requests/activities. I fought many bosses multiple times to grind for money and xp (I recommend the Seth fight if you want to farm an easy 10k xp) and just really focused on the requests (something I never expected I'd do). I also spent a lot of my time going for most of the achievements, some are locked behind Post-Game and NG+. I managed to get most achievements I wanted and they were actually fun to get, none of them were too annoying and required a lot of patience to get. So I'm sure trophy hunters will be pleased to here this. The story is phenomenal and really is Persona 5 2, I cannot recommend this game enough to existing Persona fans and newcomers to the series, if you want to experience something P5 related but can't get any of the main games, GET THIS ONE! It's such a joy to play thought, the characters, the world, the gameplay, and especially the music! Lyn and Lotus Juice once again knock it out of the park with the amazing songs that are in this game. I am leaving this game with some of my favourite Persona songs: songs such as Daredevil and Counterstrike are just phenomenal. If you haven't heard them yet I suggest looking them up on Youtube. I love, love, love, love this game's OST and think it's one of the best in the series (mainline and spin-offs included). If you're debating on purchasing this game, then as I die-hard Persona fan, I say go for it. Take the leap and just play this game. It's a wonderful experience. And whilst it may not be as long and as intricate as vanilla P5/Royal, it's still a fantastic experience even though it's half as long as vanilla P5. Definitely pick this game up. And I hope many more Persona games make their way to Steam so newcomers have more games to try to further push themselves into this fantastic series.\n\nScore: Pretty much expected if you've read all of my review so far but I'm going to give Persona 5 Strikers a perfect 10/10 (despite the cons I have previously listed). Please try this game if you ever get the chance it's an experience you do NOT want to miss. Thank you for reading my review and thank you to Atlus and Koei Tecmo for creating such a brilliant sequel to Persona 5.\n\n \n", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "657aa6cfcb1c596db595c52addcff5e9", "author": "6c5f9863ee3953198f6571c7286b6c07", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 1120, "content": "The Perfect Persona 5/Royal sequel!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5e255f2ef5d051d9a759a992bb4cdf68", "author": "eaaf24d3c7f5583c8079f03d1b2b158e", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 4258, "content": "this game made me moist", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5b2f1b31413c5bf3bb10162684e4c8d3", "author": "d3cf4f591df45585a4c5d3c65496d139", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 3426, "content": "Hard to farm Persona point and money", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "50ab12f4380c538f9224d0c33f9e8bab", "author": "79cd4c7b160c5836a0dad908463effdf", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 6340, "content": "Perhaps not quite on the level of Persona 5 and Royale, but it's still a fun game with a decent battle system, excellent music, and more time hanging out with the gang.

I love this game, I love the combat flow, the gameplay, the music, all of it. A non-turn-based Persona game is something I didn't know I wanted, but something I absolutely needed. Being able to just go nuts and fight through hordes of enemies is satisfying in a way. The Dire Shadows are a nice challenge to overcome, unless you're like me who forgot they existed until the final boss and cheesed most of them. The requests section is also a nice feature, just going after small goals for small or helpful rewards that you can just choose to completely ignore if you're on a time crunch or just hate having fun. I like being able to re-fight bosses but I am still upset that you can't re-fight Cognitive-Joker. Like every warriors game though, your AI party members suck ass, but that's to be completely expected. They do what they need to do so you can go ham on the enemies and not have to constantly worry about yourself. Until you get into late-game or are underlevelled/powered, then that's just on you.

Great game, but I've had my own wave of emotions playing it.\n\nIn my opinion, the game plays almost nothing like a normal musuo game. This is *very* Persona feeling, it's just not turned based. Taking advantage of elemental weakness is still EXTREMELY important (like every persona game) and I find myself rarely combo-ing normal enemies and only using it during bosses. Once you have SP items available the combat feels more like Persona 5 completely. Combo-ing becomes near useless.\n\nMy thoughts on the story and dungeon designs, I think the first half of the game is considerably better than the end half. There's some depth that is skipped for the last half of the game that makes me feel like things were rushed, or it felt like they had to piece things together in the middle, like they knew what they wanted but needed something there. Especially the final area, it felt SUPER short if you compared it to the first or second. It surprised me how fast I got to the final boss.\n\nI don't know what people mean, I've only ever crashed once while playing the entire game. If you're crashing that often I honestly think your computer just can't handle the game? The game is well optimized in my opinion.

The characters talking with each other felt as natural as it did in 5/Royal. Having the gang travel Japan was also a good decision, as it meant not being stuck in Tokyo the entire time (which they could've very easily done if they wanted).\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-From a story standpoint, Royal is never mentioned. At all. Also, all non-party confidants (except three) never appear in the game.\n-Game reminds you of romances, but doesn't actually care what you chose.\n-Game doesn't do a good job of encouraging you to switch up party members, but still forces some party members in some select fights.\n-Game isn't difficult (especially if you find the right item/bond build that allows you to mow over anything in the game).\n-Lack of combo depth.\n-Music is mostly P5 ost remixes with some new stuff (and overall, not as good as the original).\n-Where is Igor?\n-Play with a controller.\n-Story doesn't understand it's own universe's rules.\n\nTo expand upon the last point, there are two times the game contradicts their own rules. First, in the first dungeon, it's shown that, besides the party, people enter the Jails as their shadows. However, the game breaks this rule several times, and doesn't explain why.\nThe second major gaffe: Morgana mentions at the very end of the game that its the \"surprise of receiving a calling card\" that causes Desires to manifest, similar to Treasures. This is just a flat wrong explanation of how the calling cards work from both P5/Royal, as well as from the same game.\n\nAs to the other points, the combat is basic and easy, and there are ways to break it (hint: Two things break shields. weaknesses and criticals) which makes combat a joke. I used Yusuke the entire game and wasn't really punished for it, which shouldn't be ok in a game that emphasized elemental affinities.\n\nIf you can get over these somewhat minor gripes, the game is fun.

Unfortunately, this one manages to be even more predictable, but I still liked the story, even though it had some low-low moments. ( that bath scene was sad )\n\nUnfortunately, if you haven't played the original persona 5 or the royal version of it, you will not understand why these characters are important. In addition, you will, of course, receive spoilers for the original game.\n\nThe combat is fun, but you won't find DMC 5 levels of depth to it. That's fine, but the problem lies with the fact that, the combat becomes boring halfway through.\nMeaning that if the game was shorter it would fit better or if the game had more to its combat it would fit the length of the game better.\n\nThis PC port comes with a few problems that we've had since day one, the best example being the very first load screen.\nWhatever the reason, it takes a very long time to load in and sometimes it never happens.\n\n\nThis game is fine, but wait for a sale, also I highly recommend you stay away from it if you never played the original game.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a488e897444957c5bf4df1be4c4eb081", "author": "994b72fd630c508aa51da00e6b2d12da", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 1582, "content": "As much as I love persona 5 and the accelerated combat did nothing but wonders for it.

This gives you access to an array of perks, kind of like talents]\n-Must beat game first to unlock Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal battle themes (\"Last Surprise\"/\"Take Over\"), unlike the methods for Switch/PS4\n-The system for jumping to pillars, chandeliers, etc is a bit awkward and can catch you mid-combo\n-If the English voice track feels blemished or sounds off, the VAs recorded out of studio during the pandemic. It sounded fine to me with headphones on.\n\nThat said, most of the Cons are mild gripes. Except the crashing, but I blame that more on the DRM than I do the game.\n\nBut if you really want to see what the Thieves are like in action combat (which was pretty fitting for the cast), give it a try.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1bcf429966345d3384f7ce12e5be93cd", "author": "91e9f458bcb150bf857657a54a3db94f", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 5375, "content": "None of the girls remember i've plowed each one of them.\n\nNonetheless, a very pleasant return to the world of Persona 5 and the Phantom Thieves.\n\n\n(Prone to random crashes -- nothing too devastating, however you'll want to save frequently.)", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0d0c12ee70ad53339ce6b20e86235643", "author": "5a37bb58466c5c698422c31df1dcee28", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 2582, "content": "Very Simplistic.

I understand that other persona spin off games the spin offs can be quite iffy, but nothing in this game really stands out. I've never played a musou game before, but it was amazing, atleast how atlus handled it and incorporated it into the persona world, I have heard it being compared to FF7 Remake's system. While I prefer the turn based system, i definitely understand why people are now calling for this to be the main fighting system in the games. And while not having the day to day life simulator aspect, there are still social events and ways the game gives control to the player in the regular world. \n\nThis deserves not to be a looked at as a sequel, but as a worthwhile 20+ hour dlc of an already 80+ hours amazing game.

I feel pretty fancy getting to play different persona games on different platforms.\n\nOverall, if you like persona or JRPGs in general.. This is a must buy. However be warned, I do recommend playing P5 or P5R before diving into Strikers. It is an exact sequal to where P5 left off and rarely is a sequal that does benefit from playing the previous title.

This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story.

I had played Hyrule Warriors and enjoyed it quite a bit but I thought it was lacking in the story department. As more information came out about Persona 5 Strikers (or Scramble: The Phantom Strikers as the fan base knew it before it was localized) it was revealed that it was actually a full-blown sequel to the original game in the style of an action RPG. Now, this was something I could get excited about!\n\nNow that I have finished it, I can say it is a worthy successor to one of my favorite games of all time. Sure, a lot of the social aspects are gone, but that isn't really what Strikers is about. Strikers is a hack and slash road trip for the beloved Phantom Thieves, so if you love P5's cast you'll feel right at home here. HOWEVER, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT PLAYING PERSONA 5. The game assumes you're familiar with the world of that game, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by spoiling the plot of the original game. Seriously, either find a PS4 to play it or hold out a bit longer for a PC port.\n\nAs for the game itself, I found it plays more like Kingdom Hearts than Dynasty Warriors. The combat is fluid and brain-numbingly fun. Each character has unique quirks that make them exciting and fun to play as. Being able to switch between them at a moment's notice makes the combat constantly feel fresh. My only real complaint about the game is that some of the dungeons feel a little hollow, and I think the story leans too heavily into the themes of the first game. Atlus had the opportunity to do something really interesting here, and they do with the addition of some new characters. But a lot of the plot, especially near the end, feels like a retread.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of Persona 5 this is a must-buy. If not, go play the original game and come back to this. I promise you, the style, characters, and story of these games are so instantly loveable and well worth the time sink.\n\nUntil next time, Phantom Thieves.\n\n8/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bafc2084a16b56cda75dd9d95af3c8ad", "author": "a4ff99b0e3ee5c009aecd07855c0358e", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 4688, "content": "kinda wacky how I found it harder to kill a giant dick on a wagon than 1v1'ing god", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b3fd0ab1426d54629e81366fd538ef1b", "author": "1c0cb22734355ffa9ae59e38c054114f", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 1464, "content": "Haru can ride a skateboard and kill shadows with said skateboard 10/10 $70 well spent", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b35db4c4d44a58ec8c964f32c7a31992", "author": "40ec4fc02ffa514cb5ac9b658c510960", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 655, "content": "The game is very nice, but I would not purchase it if you have not yet played Persona 5.

After 100+ Hours in this game I can happily say this is another fantastic game by Atlus (and KT this time).\n\n[h1] MINIMAL STORY SPOILERS AHEAD[/h1]\n\n[b] Overview[/b]\nThe Phantom Thieves are back and they are prepared to journey across Japan. Strikers' world building feels great, even whist travelling from Tokyo to Sendai, Sapporo, Okinawa, Kyoto, Fu.kuoka and Osaka in the space of 1 month and exploring jails as they go. Each city looks fantastic and are all very lively, an improvement on Persona 5. Though the combat may look a little intimidating to long time Persona fans it feels more at home with the actual combat the Phantom Thieves would go through. The beginning, middle and end of the game is consistently great and Atlus & KT gave a masterpiece such as Persona 5 a sequel it deserved.\n\n[b] Gameplay[/b]\nThis time around the Phantom Thieves are tasked at exploring Jails across Japan, city-sized palaces ruled by some of the most powerful people in Japan. To fit the combat of Strikers, Jails are much larger than Palaces found in Persona 5 but are still filled with small details the can really grab your eye. A lot of enjoyment can be gained from just running around these Jails and mopping up shadows just for fun. \nAs I mentioned before the combat is rather different than your traditional SMT or Persona game, but the most pivotal mechanics are still used in Strikers. Every Phantom Thief has their original personas and skills but all have a unique playstyle for you to experience and decide on your 'main'. Joker still has his wildcard ability, but due to the lack of Igor in the velvet room he only has access to half the personas available in Persona 5. Their different weapons and guns make for a whole new experience depending on who you use, and their weapon actually changes in their hand if you buy a new one.\n[list]\n[*] [b] Joker[/b] - Access to all elements, fast attacks and an all-around beginners character\n[*] [b] Ryuji[/b] - Electric user, Slower bat attacks but do much more damage, focus on Physical skills and tanking\n[*] [b] Ann[/b] - Fire user, Fast whip attacks and fastest gun (Sub-Machine gun), focus on magic skills\n[*] [b] Morgana[/b] - Wind user, Fast sword attacks with a lot or aerial usage, mainly a healer\n[*] [b] Yusuke[/b] - Ice user, Normal sword attacks but with flurry combos, crit monster, focus on Physical attacks\n[*] [b] Makoto[/b] - Nuclear user, Normal fist attacks, all around nuclear powerhouse, an all-around character\n[*] [b] Futaba[/b] - Navigator, non-playable but can provide buffs, healing and protection for the team.\n[*] [b] Haru[/b] - Psy user, Very slow axe attacks but with very high damage, focus on gun attacks and combo skills\n[*] [b] Sophia[/b] - Bless user, Fast Yo-yo attacks with a Rhythm mechanic, high-skill based character but can be used as a healer[/list]\n\n[b] Overworld[/b]\nThe lack of 'daily life' of this game may put off a few from picking this game up, but the amount of interaction in the overworld decently makes up for it's absence. Every city has many NPCs to interact with and all shopkeepers have their own dialogue (and there are a lot of shops). After progression in the story the Phantom Thieves may be standing around town with dialogue of their own [strike] unfortunately it is not voiced[/strike]. They may also hand you requests which furthers the level of interaction you get from your long time allies. Every city looks vastly different from the next with their very own top tier theme, which really helps set each city apart from another. \n\n[b] Music[/b]\nC'mon, it's a Persona game, you should know by now that is has fantastic music, and this game is certainly no exception. From the opening theme all the way till the credits song, in my opinion there is no bad or even mediocre track in the entire soundtrack. Every song fits the theme it requires and makes you want to explore each area in depth just to listen to the smooth Jazz. Speaking of which, p5's Jazz theme has not disappeared, though there is a bit of a metal theme for the more intense battles, which fits the high paced combat perfectly. It's another fantastic job by Shoji Meguro, Lyn, and the whole Atlus sound team.\n\n[b] Graphics and Performance[/b]\nStrikers is a pretty good looking game, the art style of Persona 5 compliments the gameplay of Strikers, using the bold lines and bright colours doesn't get you lost in the fast-paced gameplay. The menu's are the best Persona has ever done, with smooth transitions and every character having a cameo in different sections of the menu. Unfortunately this game was also developed for the switch, which limited how far they could take the graphical aspect of the game. Also this PC port is not the greatest, the cause is unknown but on some systems certain cutscenes will crash the game if viewed in fullscreen. It isn't very well optimised either, enemies will lag out the game using Agidyne, and text looks grainy due to Anti-Aliasing. Overall this doesn't effect the experience too much but it is something to keep in mind if you are debating between buying Strikers on PC or PS4\n\n[b] Story[/b]\nThis is where Persona 5 Strikers really surprised me, as a spinoff I expected a toned down story filled with fanservice to keep the players happy but no. Strikers has a very 'persona-like' story, without the social links. Without a need to build characters (except the few new introductions) Atlus was able to fully focus on the story and make it great from the beginning until the end. The story starts a little weak but really picks up and is definitely on the level of a mainline Persona game story. Each new character fits perfectly into the story and each have their own role to play.\n\n[b] Characters[/b]\nSince this is a sequel to Persona 5 and not Royal, this game does lack Kasumi and any mention of Maruki, but the rest of the Phantom Thieves make their appearance with a new ally - Sophia, a sketchy detective -Zenkichi Hasegawa and an upbeat woman of tech - Kuon Ichinose.\nSophia is 'Humanity's Companion,' an AI Joker discovers in the depths of a Jail. Her main derivative is to learn, as she lost her memory after being dumped into this jail. She accompanies the Phantom Thieves in their trip, inside Joker's phone.  She's bright and bubbly and quite similar to Aigis from Persona 3.\nZenkichi is an employee of Public Security and has been tasked in researching the 'change of heart' epidemic that has swept across Japan. He may be a friend or foe but one thing is for sure, he'll be on your tail this whole trip.\nIchinose is a quirky tech guru that just loves her coding. She just happens to come across the Phantom Thieves and is a HUGE fan. She happily starts working with them to find the true culprit changing these hearts.\n\n[b] Final Thoughts[/b]\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great game to pick up if you're a fan of Persona or hack n slash musou games in general. There is over 100 hours worth of gameplay (including postgame) and it never gets stale. Merciless provides a great challenge in New Game+ and lets you listen to the amazing soundtrack even more.\n\n[h1] FINAL SCORE: 9.1/10[/h1]", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "960a97380da956c081936c315e58a4b2", "author": "2dbb39390f8e5aa3958213bd1f21f67b", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 2004, "content": "It is really good, think persona 5 just with the RPG combat switched out with Warrior games type gameplay.

It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game.

Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored.

The Phantom Thieves, The Mind Blowing Eargasm Soundtrack, the Cinematic Show time and All out Attacks, the Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal design has been also given to Persona 5 Strikers from the layout to the games menu to the animations and cut scenes to the city of Japan to the dungeon which were formally known as Palaces in the meta verse now known as Jails. The Fantastic Story exploring the Meta verse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow while life in the real world goes on as the Protagonist and the rest of the Phantom Thieves are on Summer vacation when things start to go downhill. Persona 5 Strikers is as good as a Season 2 of Persona 5 Apart from missing a few signature system such as Social Links from past Persona games.\n\nStory and Game Structure: \nPersona 5 Strikers takes place and continues the story from Persona 5, just pretend Persona 5 Royal didnt happen and i have to pretend i did not romance Yoshizawa Kasumi the new girl from Persona 5 Royal which was not in Persona 5. Persona 5 Strikers continues to explore the world of the Metaverse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow. The Phantom thieves are back in action to return the desires that have been stolen to their owners while also problem solving the change of hearts not by done by them to the Citizens of Japan, while the threat of the Japanese Bureau persecuting the group looms around. Given how Persona 5 Strikers has been made to be a 2nd Season of Persona 5, it is impressive that it retains the feel and Atmosphere that Persona 5 has. \n\nThe most noteable change to Persona 5 Strikers is probably the confidance system and the velvet room, the velvet room changes make Persona 5 Strikers persona fusion much simpler but the loss of confidance system and side stories that accompany them is what diverges from what a propa Persona 5 Season 2 might be. Instead you gain bond points from fighting along side with the Phantom Thieves or real time events or cooking. While these bond points allowed me to unlock new passive skills and upgrade them, i miss hanging out with the indivisual members of the Phantom Thieves hanging out with them during free time and seeing their side  PeRsOnA-L stories. Not that i mind spending less than 10 000 hours on a Persona game but i can spend any amount of time hanging out with the Phantom thieves even if it means to stop playing other games\n\nCharacters, Soundtrack and Atmosphere:\nThroughout Persona 5 Strikers the Phantom Thieves travel to different locations not just in Japan around Tokyo but to Hokkaido and Okinawa during their summer trip plus investigations but also in the meta verse where combat takes place at. The Dugenons formally known as Palaces in Persona 5 and Royal are now known as Jails and they are large and can take hours to complete. Since the jails that you are fighting in transforms the city around you, travelling back and fourth from the Jails and the real world to stock up on items and replenish HP and SP without taking up time in the real world  from previous Persona games has been implemented in Strikers which makes. Exploring different parts of Tokyo and Japan is a lot of fun just like Persona 5 or Royal even if its for the simplest things such as stocking up on items. Both the Duengons and the Map of Persona 5 Strikers are well desgin and made to be memorable. \n\nThe fan favourite Phantom Thieves are back along side new addition Sophia (Rip Kasumi Yoshizawa from Persona 5 Royal) and i don't think there is any game that i have played that has any more memorable characters than those from the Persona 5 series, while also having different personalities they each have something that will make you fall in love with them. The voice acting and animations are also are very well done. Persona 5 Strikers sound track just like any other Persona game i have played is also mind blowing, memorable and just way too good that it gives me and Ear gasm whenever i am listening to it.\n\nCombat:\nPersona 5 Strikers introduce a totally different style in combat by making players stratagize the use of their Persona skills and other mechanics that were from Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal such as the gun mechanics and the cinematic all out attacks and Show Time attacks. Fighting in Persona 5 Strikers feels good as it feels like im playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal using my Persona skills but also combo-ing skills with the Phantom Thieves that i choose to play as not to mention the different personallties of each character and variety of skills and combos they have. Making use of the enemys weakness in Persona 5 Strikers and using Persona skills is also a important aspect of Persona 5 Strikers as you will want to do enough damage to their weak point to use a All out or Show time attack especially against Bosses and higher level enemys since they usually have a large health pool and can soak up a lot of damage. Every Phantom Thieve in Persona 5 Strikers is playable and they each have different fighting styles and combos you can have up to 4 members of the Phantom Thieves in your party however Joker must be in the squad no matter who you choose to have along side with him. The strategy base mechanics such as using Persona Skills switching members of your party or switching the Phantom Thieve that your are currently playing as becomes even more important or harder difficulties.\n\nPros:\n-The Story of Persona 5 Season 2\n-Retains the Feel of Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal\n-Real time combat with turn base mechanics such as Persona Skils etc while also carrying over Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal mechanincs such as Show-time attacks, Gun uasge and All out attacks etc\n-Mind Blowing Ear-gasm Soundtrack\n-Map and Duengon aka Jails Design\n-Voice Acting and Characters\n\nCons:\n-Occasional Crashes on patch 1.0\n-Unanswered answers for players yet to Play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal\n-No Confidance system\n-Slice of Life system from calander has been cut down\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers story is what a Persona 5 Season 2 might be making this summer vacation and road trip around Japan fun, memorable and loving for fans of Persona 5 and Royal but confusing for anyone new to it.  Persona 5 is one of my favourite JRPGS, it has a mind blowing soundtrack, its world is immersive and relatable filled with loveable and memorable characters and supporting characters alongside a really rich story. The only let down being the Confidance System and the Slice of Life Calander system from previous titles which was missing.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 7, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0e6607d382155928a5f0f7f1a4032a49", "author": "59e74bd6ea985c9b8185eff9a64630e5", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 2116, "content": "An excellent follow up to Persona 5!

Overall Persona 5 Strikers is a unique take on the Persona franchise, and a summary of my thoughts on it could be summed up to *almost* more of the same if you're coming from Persona 5, or a somewhat familiar but also not-so familiar experience if you're coming from Persona 4 Golden, even though this installment in the series has wildly different gameplay from both Persona 5 *and* Persona 4 Golden. Details below.\n\nBefore I talk about anything else though, discussing the story must come first, as Persona 5 Strikers is set *after* the events of the main game of Persona 5 (NOT Royal, as I believe Strikers was released in Japan before Royal debuted anywhere). Following that, naturally the experience is enhanced if you have played Persona 5 from start to finish, and a few things about the mainline title are naturally spoiled. THAT SAID, Strikers actually does a very good job of being vague to the events of Persona 5 with the least amount of spoilers possible, so you can absolutely get away with playing this without playing Persona 5 first. Just be warned that a few things *are* spoiled, so it's definitely not spoiler free.\n\nMoving right along, the plot is written very well I thought; I went into this not actually expecting much, but I came out of it pleasantly surprised. Strikers' storytelling is identical to that of Persona 5 (surprising absolutely nobody), except this time all of your party members are right there from the get go. ATLUS introduces the new characters very nicely; I was fully expecting the new characters to feel a little awkward and forced, but they quickly found their place within the rest of the cast, and by the end they felt like they belonged and have been there all along. At some points, I felt as if Strikers had even stronger story points than Persona 5.\n\nThe gameplay I thought was unique; this game is a full on hack-n-slash beat-em-up type of game, which is very different from the main titles in this franchise. A word of warning that it never really changes its combat up too much throughout the entire game, so it becomes repetitive after a while. I frequently had to take breaks because of how repetitive it can get, and I found myself thinking that taking on additional requests that you get throughout the game to be kind of a chore since there's no real variety in the requests that you get. However, what *is* there is fun; the hack and slash combined with the tried and true persona summons works very well. There are a variety of combos to remember, and each character has their own set, along with their own elemental strengths and weaknesses previously seen in Persona 5. If you've played Persona 5, the old cast will feel pretty familiar as a result. It's worth trying every character out as soon as you're able to as well, since every character plays differently as far as their combos go. Pro tip: make sure you get comfortable with a myriad of party members too. It will not only expand your tool set when confronting powerful shadows, but there's a specific part where you'll have to basically use all of them at some point.\n\nPerformance wise, this game runs very well on my GTX 1080; I didn't see a single frame drop, except for one spot in one of the dungeons which turned out to be a complete one off situation. This game is optimized well, but the only problem is that this game has a tendency to crash when loading into and out of the Metaverse. Please remember to save often, as crashing at some points could mean having to redo tough fights. I myself crashed twice at one specific section and had to play the same section three times total before I finally got through it. Those two crashes were the only crashes I had within my 45 hours of game time, however.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a great hack-n-slash game, and is a very good extension to Persona 5.

It faithfully implements mechanics from the rest of the series in an action combat form. If you play on hard mode, it's a significant challenge and much more fun, as you have to pay attention to what skills the enemies are using on screen.\n\nYou probably should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first, as there's a lot of references to it that you might miss. You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out. The story can be a bit nonsense sometimes, but is fun nonetheless. There is no calendar time slot system like in Persona 5. The calendar only moves on with certain story events.

The story is as funny and emotional as ever and there are improvements on almost every level; The music is great, the characters still keep their development from the last game, the UI somehow tops the original, and the combat is very fun and addicting. I would suggest this game for everybody but the characters often refrence moments and characters from the original game and don't explain complex things over again like the metaverse or Morgana.\n\nThis section is to grade how worth it the digital deluxe edition is:\nThe digital deluxe edition is hard to say the quality off. In order to access the content you need to push the Play button specifically in Steam for the game and it will ask whether you want to play the game or the 'app'. The quality of the app is very sketchy as right from the start it has a Unity watermark at the beginning. It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c97e753ee7045541bbe8283760f84a3d", "author": "a69225708ac35e238ae845a73acc48eb", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 1699, "content": "this right here is the best persona game i've played\n\nalso it has zenkichi\n\nbuy it\n\nzenkichi is great", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c423e057d0f25d2c84d9fcbdd1a7f29c", "author": "1809e460cc7a5f2c83f998d82527c6cd", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 1055, "content": "I wish i could give it 4/5 its a great game but it crashes and i am constantly saving every chance i get. i want to enjoy the game but its hard if the gam,e keeps crashing. \n\nFun game but fix the crashes so i can be less stressed out about redoing everything again. ive stopped 30 min in because i just lost 30 min of work.\n\nFun game but fix the dumb crashes seriously.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bdc5ec6dc7c057ff9122cb7a41a4018e", "author": "35aedd65173358bc8bdc52d43ba7d05b", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 861, "content": "I love this game it's a top tier Dynasty Warrior style game like Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity.

Even though it transitioned from a turn-based RPG to an action-based musou game, it still feels very much like Persona, with every gameplay staple intact. Weaknesses, technicals, elements, baton pass, and more; all wrapped up in a sexy and stylish art style and UI that's basically Persona 5's trademark. I often get bored of musou games very quickly because of it's extremely repetitive nature and simplistic combat, but Strikers does not have this problem at all since, like I mentioned, it has all of the gameplay staples you'd expect from a Persona game, which wildly varies the gameplay and always keeps you on your toes; especially if you play on higher difficulties. The SP system is also back where you can't recharge SP unless you return to the real world, or use items which are either expensive or hard to come by. This encourage you to constantly swap party members so you keep your gameplay variety fresh and entertaining (along with characters getting new passives or skills the more you play as them).\n\nThe only negatives I can really say about Strikers is that there is significantly less real-life activities to do. They are still there, and you can explore and talk to people, but the volume of stuff you can do is significantly lessened from P5. This is because you no longer have a time limit to complete your objective in the metaverse.

There's no big introduction to the main cast and there's references to P5 that you'd have to play to understand.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a09b96462f465a3480cfc6f8cf05aa77", "author": "a2a2b1fdb19b56fba582c8d0f532c56d", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 872, "content": "I love the Persona franchise and from what I've played so far of this game I can definitely reccommend it, but definitely not in the state that it is right now (1.0.0)\n\nThe biggest issue for me is the loading times, 2 minutes to load to the main menu and 1 minute to load a save file off an SSD is ridiculous.\n\nI didn't refund the game as I am actually enjoying it but the loading times and random crashes are absolutely awful, and I truly hope they get fixed.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9929308a2f6454a6814131ab93260073", "author": "175656f8e7ea58019e38563fa59494ef", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 412, "content": "basically persona 5 2 very good has a intreging  storyline and very fun 2 play i highly reccomend", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "98b79df1d92f5568a5448900e37f815c", "author": "50da0ce9754e545dbb94f404fa76213e", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 2918, "content": "Finished the game yesterday, would highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed the original game and its characters!\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised by how substantial the game turned out to be -- My save logged 38 hours, and I kinda rushed through the game because I was so invested in the story, so other people might have longer times if they went out of their way to do all the optional content as well.\n\nLoved all the interactions between the original cast, the new additions of Zenkichi and Sophia were absolutely fantastic and played off the main group wonderfully, the soundtrack is phenomenal (as was to be expected, really), the story was fun and in true Persona fashion, the combat was fun and all in all I basically found myself unable to put the game down until I beat it, lol. Speaking of the combat, I really love the showtime and all-out attack mechanics! They're super extra and I love it whenever I get the chance to use one.\n\nThe plot of the game may have been a little predictable in some areas *because* it was in true Persona fashion, but it really did not feel detrimental to the game at all and it was still a very enjoyable experience regardless (and it also felt very nice to have a theory forming in your head to turn out to be true too)!\n\nAll in all, P5S really felt like a good and proper sequel game to me despite it not being in the classic Persona game format.

Everything this game has shown off to me has put a big dumb smile on my face. The great combat system and bond point system, the returning music tracks along with new ones are always amazing, and the new characters that this game introduces are all great. If you're like me and have played Persona 5 but are on the ropes about trying this game, I highly recommend. Do be aware though, this game takes place after the events of the original Persona 5, not Royal. So don't expect there to be any references or any characters exclusive to Persona 5 Royal. I do also highly advise playing the original or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game in order to understand the Phantom Thieves more and so you're not completely confused on the story.

Playing Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal is not necessary to follow the story, but it does enrich the experience. The characters are fun as always - including the new ones - and the combat actually has a fair amount of depth to it. It uses a lot of the Persona from P5 in a sort of action-rpg type of way, slowing down time to allow the player to pick the correct ability. Also, each playable character has their own unique mechanics, so while you can switch freely between each character and know basically how to play them, there is definitely room to improve with them. All the characters are viable, so I found myself switching them to fit the situation.\n\nThe music is... [i]chef's kiss[/i]. \n\nThe only gripe I have about the game is the lack of social links, or rather the opportunities they offered to spend time with the characters. The Bond system is sort of the replacement here, with completing certain social activities gives points that are dropped into stat-enhancing modifiers, and the ability to unlock new modifiers by doing requests for different characters.\n\nI hope the release of this game and Persona 4 Golden on Steam are signs that Atlus will be bringing Persona 5 Royal to PC, but in the meantime this will do just fine. P5S stands on its own with a well-written story, gratifying gameplay and a reunion (or introduction) with this series' lovable thieves.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "30677ec613a45150a74d6c5e04cfac37", "author": "c8e66a2ded6f53c0b7df4868dfa35df9", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 663, "content": "Persona 5 good gam e", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2ceddbb33d8650bab8d4ecbd37c36754", "author": "6a88ab429044507390375da52b35d83d", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 610, "content": "The original Persona 5 is a phenomenal game, so anything related to it is a good time.

Instead i feel frustrated as the enemies(especially the strong one) are very not balance until i reach 'not fun' point. Fair point i play the game in hard mode, but in Royal i played 'Merciless' difficulty in first playthrough, but it was still very doable and feel very fun. I know it's a different genre, but by holding 'Persona 5' title it should reach a same experience.\n\nP5 Strikes also feels very boring for me. It's repetitive and defeating enemies isn't satisfying. I think it's a problem in UX delivery, where in any original Persona's battle we potentially see something new like new enemy, new potential persona, new item, yada yada yada. Strikes has a contradiction design, while ambushing enemy is using same approach as Persona 5, but then every battle information is using musou game style, for example every item and new persona shown in the mid battle. How the **** i could see that in the mid of chaos, why not just using Persona 5 style T_T where everything we got is shown in the end of battle. This problem leads to I feel I don't get anything and not rewarded, heck i even often didn't know i have a new persona. Fusing a new persona is also not really that exciting, as i know i will be pummeled again by the enemy. It's unfortunate where Persona 5 main strength is UI/UX with their very awesome style.\n\nAnd lastly no Kasumi is a huge experience gap and it feels strange for me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "baa8c0faab02531a9c21f3952765da74", "author": "8e66ff8146205e08814aa11ce2be24a1", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 1645, "content": "i knew this game was a sequel way before it dropped but holy shit i didn't think y'all would just go and make fuckin' persona 5 2", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b9a86bf1722557679cf45ca7207a89d8", "author": "989c07ef262b515f919c4133cbcf24f2", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 470, "content": "Great game, love the graphic's and the battle style! totally would recommend!!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b8bdd338ef2a5860acdca7e27942559f", "author": "6b3af8391b7759008d5001bb5d5e91ed", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 830, "content": "unique take on a hack and slash game with the Persona series", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b4bcd06b9c74591ba648db2a291c6291", "author": "232d9bfb1fec5ffa9ba642421f4f2146", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 2826, "content": "A worthy sequel to Persona 5.

THIS PREVENTS CRASHES! Make sure the aspect ratio matches your monitor, this will prevent the ONLY crashing I've ever had in this game.

I've never been a Dynasty Warriors fan because all they ever do is rehash the same thing over and over again, and it rarely has any substance. They made a terrible Fate game series, an ok Zelda series, but they finally figured something out. (Of course, Atlus was there to watch over development like a nosy teacher looking over a child doing their homework. But this teacher knows how to teach properly.)\n\nThere hasn't been any problems with the game. You know, like real games when they were released when they were ready. No EA \"We'll fix it later\" shit. \n\nHow The Game Plays: This feels like a Persona game. Let me emphasize this. The battles still have a bit of strategy to them. You can't just run blindly in (at least on Hard difficulty) and wack hack away. And for people who don't want to play a game with battle substance, or the possibility of losing, you have Normal mode. If your 6 year old brother wants to play, you got easy mode. It's perfect. They got a difficulty for all types! And you don't have to start the game over if you find out Normal doesn't cut it 2 hours into the game like I did. \n\nPersona fans will enjoy this. Dynasty Warrior fans will enjoy it. People who hate reading, plot, and character development will despise it. But I suppose if you hate reading in the first place, you probably didn't read this far.\n\nEdit: Beat the game. This is THE BEST Dynasty Warriors game. Better than Dynasty Warriors, better then Zelda, etc. I only wish Makoto would call me back....", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a74ee75f4d9f5855b53b45135838d118", "author": "6a5a17284f6f54f8beb78c4dc9672621", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 1308, "content": "0/10, no pancake boy", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a56abff18b975a72b6e5d6563e5ce7df", "author": "0c2e4614d1255d66853a8831846cb2f9", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 3529, "content": "More persona = yes please", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9de226d18a245e1b981b0fc331fc8dd1", "author": "5c6f66d2e422541a9f0954cd629d9904", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 2373, "content": "persomna 5 but not turn base", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9bd12b8782d45ec1bccbf6d72ed80aa5", "author": "5eddc357b0f854468498ae4579e358b2", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 885, "content": "A great game.

It has worked on everything I have put it on lately and that's a sigh of relief. Enjoy the game! I will not delete the original review because it is important to note issues at launch.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI want to start off by saying this game is an amazing game and a full 10/10... WHEN IT WORKS! I have a beast of a PC and the game runs super well when it decides to. However the game crashes over and over again. It will do so completely randomly as well. And to me I save every chance I can get and still end up losing 20 minutes to an hour each time. of the 26 hours clocked only 17 are on my file because I have lost that much time in the game due to random crashes. \n\nMost of the crashes occur during loading screens. However I did experience one crash in the middle of dialogue and another in the menu. Again I love this game but after the 12th crash I have decided enough is enough. I will suffer the bugs and crashes to finish this game but I DO NOT suggest anybody even try this game until they fix their crashing issues. As a huge fan of the Megaten series I am severely disappointed in the lack of QA for this game. I only have thios here on steam but I have read reports of the PS4 version also crashing on PS5 so it seems the console ports have issues as well although I would imagine far less. \n\nI appreciate the challenge and old feel of a Dedicated area to save (you can only save in the real world or checkpoints in the Jails) but because of a lack of a Autosave feature the crashes have become unbearable. \n\nMy luck is terrible as it has crashed at the worst possible times for me including after an hour of gameplay that could not be saved between. An autosave would have saved me the anger from losing that. Even then I feel like I have given enough time to this game for it to not just be a one off issue.\n\nFor the love of god I hope Atlus and Sega will FIX THE CRASHES! Unacceptable!\n\nEdit: I switched from my Samsung Evo 970 Plus to my SATA Samsung QVO 860 SSD and the crashes completely stopped. I switched back and it crashed. If you have a laptop with only an NVME drive stray from this game as it bugs out with them. I still think it's the Denuvo DRM lacking support for the NVMe drivers. They need to fix this and last I checked there were no Update patches yet. If they release one I will test and update the review once again.\n\nGame is fantastic though. Just be aware that you need a Outdated ancient technology to avoid crashes. Which is still unacceptable of a positive review. Get this on PS4 instead.\n\n\nMy Specs are\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600X\nMSI X470\nNvidia RTX 2060 Super\n32GB 3600MHZ DDR4 Ram\nWindows 10 Pro\n1TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus NVME SSD\n1TB Samsung QVO 860 SATA SSD\nKingston 480GB SATA SSD\n2x 4TB 7200rpm HDDs in Raid 0\n\n(I have tested it on all storage drives and it only crashes consistently on the NVMe drive)", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "59baf40680645a02991af40d8bef3f61", "author": "0e7e9f267b1f51a4ab640ac436544a6b", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 480, "content": "Please, I literally need PERSONA 5 ROYAL!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "57700e0901ce5527abfb9ed552c2716a", "author": "ec816665e2fe5fe7b85b5c804322d698", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 1857, "content": "much fun much wow, i just need the other persona games", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5587d9c27f2b555a91a0dc7010dfd455", "author": "50b242d33ce554c7b37af9609fdc763c", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 2738, "content": "The worst part about this game is that it ends.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "546c1922541d57c7bc2cd477a4a5c9a4", "author": "9e8d5d61d91a5502aa4b804c747e5c02", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 266, "content": "It's a solid game, though I do really, really wish there was an option to add in certain choices from the original, relationships and specifics on what you did on Persona 5.

But for some reason the game is so damn boring. \n\nI think it's because I pre-ordered Persona 5 when it was first announced. Then also got the Royal version too and spent so much time on them that they are leagues better than this game. I think if your new get the original ones but if you have played them this maybe a okay DLC/Extension to the game\n\nHere is my overview: \n\nThe story is pretty much the same with weaker reasons\nThe fact that Joker feels like the weakest character \nEvery other character besides Joker feels really nice to play as my favorite is Ryuji \nThat you can't multi select or buy \nThe Persona system is more toned down\nCombat is cool at the start but very boring and repeat the same thing over and over again\nIt's like this - In a Dynasty Warriors game you fight large armies with your character but feel like a Badass. In this game when you start a fight you have to wait for a cut-scene. You're not a badass (Oddly since it's after the main game and you're basically a GOD KILLER) and the persona drops are a bit random.\nThe camera is odd when you do a spell/persona attack it doesn't reset the camera and there's no button for it to rest the camera. \nThe mini Map doesn't rotate - For me this is super annoying\nSeems like a lot of random stuff just to do the same fights over and over again \nOh and there's so many tutorial pop-ups I thought the original Persona 5\u2019s were bad but this is so much.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4454742c55fa5c7b9d8e78bdb22b7ee7", "author": "ec6a65d24bf857e59f39f7f063cac8e1", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 350, "content": "love the game (although it has some difficulty spikes in some areas) but don't buy until the frame rate get fixed and crashes get fixed)\n\nEdit: it seems as though it has been fixed and the game goes on sale sometime so buy it then", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3ff89a7623195b5e924389dc745d7c75", "author": "7458608cb89f5e968177a6a7532ee6b0", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 4669, "content": "Toughest prison to break out is in your mind\nNow, when I finished it on hard and started my merciless run I can write this rewiew\nMy Exp in Persona games consists of P4G, P5 and P5R\nSo, lets go to the diff, pros and contras\n\nFirst and the most is new combat system. It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3e96026a4546527abf058f0cade0fdb4", "author": "996b14be37ee5c569990deef50238737", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 3160, "content": "This port is not it.

You get to interact with the party and the cutscenes you share with the Phantom Thieves are all quite cozy and just plain JRPG comfort food. \n\nSecond, this is NOT turn based combat, it's a sort of spin on Dynasty Warriors, meets active RPG, meets mild turn based mechanics. Sound messy? It is when you first jump in, but after everything is explained to you? You'll be gliding through combat like a beast. Essentially you have buttonmashing combos to take out trash, you can add some spice by changing what buttons you hit for different actions to occur. Whenever you press the \"Summon\" key (the key to actively bring out your Persona, you are given a list of spells and abilities to select from, time is halted during this. Additionally, there is gunplay, all you do is target enemies with a gun and fire at them--time slows down to like 1/8th speed during this mechanic.I will note that despite this being in the \"Dynasty Warriors\" archetype of games, I find it an unfitting description. This is still an RPG, and the boss fights DO require some strategy, if you run in mashing you will not have much success on these fights, on top of this, it feels less tiresome because you see when encounters are going to occur as opposed to your map just being flooded constantly with enemies.\n\nThird, ever wanted to play as any of the other Phantom Thieves? Guess what, that's a thing this time. In fact, it's an encouraged mechanic-the Baton Pass system in this one can help you juggle powers by switching characters when prompted-it can get nasty if done right. On top of the Baton passes, each character has a set of \"Mastery Skills\", and these were just delightful treasures, I remember each time I unlocked a new one for a character (four mastery skills per character)  I couldn't help but laugh and think \"That sounds overpowered\", oh yeah, they all felt that way-if you know how to play and use the characters skills? You'll turn into a monster on the battlefield. \n\nFourth, the freaking music. Dear god. The. Freaking. Music. This game follows the standard Persona series tradition of having music that's just outright amazing-the fact that they give you the soundtrack with this is simply amazing. I cannot endorse this game's music enough. If you've played the series previously, you know what to expect.\n\n\n\nA few other things.\n-Dynamic artstyle that looks just as flashy as always.\n-Lower system requirements, meaning some older rigs out there can run it.\n-Japanese and English voice options (both are wonderful, and all voice actors returned for their roles.)\n-Game is optimized for any controller type, I normally wouldn't think I'd have to mention this, but I just played another title that was not equipped for all controller types. \n\n\n\nI've bought a plethora of games on Steam, and done a small handful of reviews. (I owe another JRPG a review... better get on that one too.) This is one that I strongly encourage you all to purchase and play. It's a solid experience and worth your time. Ideally, this will also give Atlus the incentive they need to release all future (and perhaps previous) SMT titles on PC so I don't have to own a console for the sole purpose of their games.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "33ebc5a362fe5c4fbccf3285ab6098ad", "author": "3c442323806d593da4c9da96697d664f", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 626, "content": "P5 Story with some light Muso combat instead of turnbased.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3395357439f85f7c90a815ca2f925e32", "author": "c26aeac849cf5334a4910d0ffd8db81f", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 502, "content": "Love Persona but this game KEEPS CRASHING ON STARTUP.

Don't get me wrong I do like that system. This game is more easy to understand and defeat enemy opponents as you get to know their weakness from the start with the third-eye ability and Futaba analysing the enemy mid & start of combat. Which makes sense since this game is based right after the original Persona 5 game. So Joker would know all enemies weakness and what persona mask he should use to strike their weakeness.\n\nWhen you have the correct characters while in the jail you can then use them to strike the enemy weakness and do massive amounts of damage, they do have environmentals attacks in sum jails that can alleviate the problem of accidentally initiating combat with characters that do not have the correct abilities to strike the enemy weakness. On the other hand, you can just max out Joker's slots with persona masks from fusion or the compendium in the velvet room, and hope he has the right mask with the right ability to strike the enemy weakness during that combat situation but that's inefficient as it would just deplete Jokers stamina making him useless, unless you pump him with items that can recover his SP.\n\nHowever, a solution they can introduce is that I would loved for them to bring back the ability to switch out characters during combat by idk a bond upgrade since they removed the social aspects from the game.\n\nAnother thing I kinda dislike is the inventory system, I hate having to pause the combat to then scroll down a ton of purchased items to find the correct item to use to for example recover SP to a character that's out of stamina. \n\nA solution they could add to fix this would be a redesign in which they categories the inventory to have HP items in one section, SP items in another and lastly the curables ailments items in different sections for quick and easy location and applying the item on said character that needs it.\n\nI will not mention story as I would like to not spoil it for any persona fan that hasn't played it but overall it a good hack and slash game and story in my opinion does seem kinda rushed but it's great.\n\nFor price, I would loved to have paid \u00a310 less but I'm still happy with my purchase.

First, according to other reviews, the crashes are still a major issue for some people, so I might have just gotten lucky, and people should be aware of it. Second, I think it pretty accurately expresses what I love about the game.\n\nIf they fix the crashes, this is an amazing game. If they fix the crashes, I can give this a positive review. If they fix the crashes, I can talk about how this game brings back the same feeling I had playing Persona 5. If they fix the crashes, I would recommend this to both Musou and Persona fans alike. If they fix the crashes, I can say that this actually feels like it would even appeal to people who weren't ever fans of either. Please fix the crashes, This game obviously had a lot of effort and love poured into it, especially for something that I was expecting to be a quick cash-grab. There's no reason it should have the negative reviews that it does. It truly is amazing if only it lacked the technical issues.

In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c0ed14b0656658c4b8c78cefd03286f0", "author": "70ad254ffe465edcaadbff6d6fafb69d", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 2182, "content": "Perfect sequel to P5.

The story itself is pretty stand-alone, but the interactions that some of the characters experience or reference aren't.\n\nCombat itself, while intensely different from the mainline game, is quite enjoyable both from the standard attacks, various ways the different characters you can control function, the way weaknesses are handled, all the way to the All-Out Attacks not just being a 1-hit KO necessarily. All of the systems provide depth to the combat, but don't complicate it too much to allow the player to still fully master it in the course of normal gameplay.\n\nStory, Voice Acting, Music, all are Top Notch just like the mainline Persona 5 game. All are accentuated by no Confidant system being in this game like in Persona 5. While that might be a detriment in some aspects of truly getting to know some characters and having more 1-on-1 interactions between characters, it can also help keep the story going at a smooth pace with how the 'dungeons' are laid out.\n\nBoth a pro and a con at the same time in different aspects, is the fact that there is no time/day management in this game like in the Persona mainline games. This means that there's not as much planning needed for those that were hoping for that aspect. However, it also means that players can go back and truly explore and 100% the 'dungeons' and such without worry that they will miss something because they mismanaged their in-game time/dates.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a6dec90fd98056469f2fc9802ae00776", "author": "2e25c03ee59959bca36847fce4aeb5ce", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1774, "content": "every persona game gives me post game depression", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a6b1432f72e8557588ba122fda5c1ced", "author": "7b3ddacdcedc57f9a5ca3709de487339", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1380, "content": "Totally recommended if you played Persona 5.

Easy answer, yes! Complicated answer, wait a little bit.\nFirst, as much as Atlas says this is a standalone title, it really isn't. As far as I gotten into the game, there were many past references to the original Persona 5 game (unfortunate how it's only on ps4/ps5 for now\u2026) If you haven't already, play the first game. Ignore royal, waste of time haha. Besides that, I would consider it a direct sequel to Persona 5. Ever play Bayonetta (a very fun game as well, totally recommend)? It's very similar to Strikers, pretty much going into the \u201chack and slash category\u201d. I would suggest you use a controller too unless you have long flexible fingers. Keybinds for keyboard are kinda all over the place, so if you have the patience unlike me, Strikers supports change of keybinds (controller still recommended). Now, performance wise\u2026. Considering that it's a new game, there are lots of random crashes, and bugs here and there which ruins the entire persona experience, which is why I believe you should wait to buy this game till a patch gets pushed out. BUT! This game is great, takes elements from its different titles and mixes them.

Wait till patches and updates come out for the game if you are thinking of purchasing this game.\n\n[b] edit:[/b] also, after the [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] boss fight, my game wouldn't load, i have restarted the game even my computer numerous times, i cannot continue onward after that, so the game is unplayable for me, please fix this issue ASAP.\n\n[b] edit 2: [/b] so, after Atlus/Sega fix the issues by giving it a more stable platform shape as a hotfix, i can finally continue the game. After finishing it, one thing is certain, it a rollercoaster of emotions and after they fix it, definitely recommend this game to Persona lovers, even thought its no longer a  J-RPG, they certainly put the effort to make the hack and slash aspect better. Now, i can finally say with certainty...i definitely Recommend this game.", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3716b4b2484c5642a0b9be2c1e913761", "author": "ae6b825843325379a225c1d68570e946", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1721, "content": "You can kill shadows with a skateboard", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "35733121dd265681bdbf6e05c90a0e2b", "author": "004ee73573a951c2914183e4160d9076", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1020, "content": "Would reccomend so far but i've crashed around 5 times so far throughout 14 hours of gameplay at very vital moments and it is very frustrating.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "31fd2632082951b3a2b47058a2f0c642", "author": "6598e5ec37b550ba8e0176ad73d82fbd", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 611, "content": "Fun combat system and has the core aspects of Persona 5 in it well enough to not feel like a spin off as much as you might think.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2b786b1b703a5caeb09b3e92bb56ab88", "author": "fd33fd2449b55cccab0059e68797a429", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1750, "content": "Very good game, don't play if you haven't played the original P5 because its a direct sequel.

It has a lot of what i wanted in the original Persona 5, the phantom thieves acting more like friends rather than teammates, because everyone is introduced immediately, the game has freedom for you to see them acting as friends, the writing is consistently witty and actually funny and not forced, and even while going through the \"palaces\" of the game (which they are called jails now), there is so much idle and situational dialogue it genuinely feels great to see everyone interacting with each other. \n\nThe combat is smooth and slick and keeps the absolute overwhelming sense of style as in the games prior, every character has their own gimmicks and unlockable techniques if you play as them for long enough, adding something new and it never once felt as if im forcing myself through battles, when you're strong, the game makes you feel like it and its just so cool.\n\nThe story and new characters we're also very interesting and the final parts of the game felt very reminiscent of the final palace of Persona 5 Royal, which is a nice touch, you also unlock the og Persona 5 and Persona 5 royal battle music after beating the game, as well as some extra things that add replay value to the game.\n\nThe only downside is, as I'm sure you've heard, the game is not a stranger to crashing, while my game has crashed only twice, i suggest saving very often when you are playing the game since when you crash, you have to go back to your latest save file,  hopefully these problems get fixed. \n\ntldr: its a very great experience and more of the Phantom thieves we know and love, with a DRIPPY soundtrack and combat, i say it's worth the price, i cans see the love that went into this game. It can crash but the only way to remedy that for now is to just save as often as you can.

I myself used the nvidia control panel fixes (plus setting the exe to run as admin) and it has completely solved the load time and load crash issues I've suffered. (as far as I can tell atleast)\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, yes even those that have already played Persona 5. First off this game is fully based on the Persona 5 Original version of the world, not the Royal remake. If this bothers you please keep in mind that this game was released in Japan long before Royal was made. Keep in mind that this game also happens after the events of P5 so I fully recommend you play P5 first unless you came here specifically for the combat system over the story, at that point you'll be fine most of the major plot points revolve around current happenings anyways, I myself came for the story so...\n\nPoint on the combat system. If you already played P5 or P5 Royal you might have issue with the combat system as it takes the, beat the life out of waves of enemies with everything you got, approach over the turn-based quality over quantity enemies that the mainline games have. The fusion system is slightly simplified as is the persona strengthening system. You are slightly screwed out of you're previous sources of items, armor, and weapons, but in turn you have and adorable new character who will handle most of your material needs. You also have Joker's awakened cooking abilities and a 100% fixed flow of time, also UNLIMITED TRANSIT between the real world and the metaverse, due to the shorter in-game time you are given to clear the palace. DAYS WILL ONLY PASS ALONGSIDE STORY PROGRESSION. No getting bad ends because you spent to long getting pestered by Mona to sleep. There is also a million other little things you'll learn as you play that differ from the mainline games but you'll learn them fairly easily.\n\nI dearly love the Persona games alongside it's older edgier cousin. And so far the game has been amazing for a spin-off of a spin-off series. You do have to look at it like persona Q in that it is fairly different from the game or games that it spawned from. Igor is once again eating popcorn far away from the side disaster probably drinking tea with his boss. So just, realize that like a lot of games, you won't know how much you'll enjoy a game till you play it or see the systems in action.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "07e59557b8c65ab48adb4b535b8884c4", "author": "0775cc1dacb9555e947a6cd6b5b84996", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 411, "content": "A fun button-masher / visual novel following the story of the summer after Persona 5.

Turn based RPGs have their fans, but there are many people who find their gameplay loops to be unengaging. Persona 5 Strikers does an amicable job of bridging the gap, bringing classic persona tropes and mechanics to a more action oriented gameplay style. \n\nThis is no Musso/Warriors game, at least not in the same style of Hyrule Warriors or One Piece Pirate Warriors. If anything this plays more like a faster paced Kingdom Hearts game, for better and for worse. This game oozes with style, and its gameplay mechanics are just deep enough to be interesting while not going too deep into combo centric button strings. \n\nThat said, it's far from perfect. First and most glaring are the crashing issues. This game needs you to save often, and a mistimed crash can erase a good bit of effort since saving while dungeon crawling is limited to checkpoints. A saving system like this is fine, but when your game will crash without warning- it makes the checkpoint system feel less like a stopgap and more like a slight to a player who lost 40 minutes of exploring because they didn't save. \n\nBeyond that, it's a direct sequel to Persona 5, which is not available on the PC. This doesn't make the game unenjoyable to new fans, but it does throw you right back into the action assuming you know most everything about the Phantom Thieves and their six months at Shujin Academy. Despite the gameplay being a perfect way to introduce someone not usually into RPGs into Persona- the story is perhaps the exact opposite. Although for those who played 5, or at least read some wiki pages to get some backstories, the story is a fun romp across Japan with some touching moments. \n\nAll in all, Strikers is a good game. I hesitate to call it great for I believe a lot of my personal enjoyment comes from getting to see these characters again and a drive to 100% the game. Be wary of glitches and crashes- they will ruin some of the fun and you need to be prepared for that. But if you want some fun action combat drenched in Persona 5's signature style with some more of the Phantom Thieves: it's certainly going to scratch that itch for you.

This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.", "comments": 16, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eea9fbf55e00531093a8a2faf8c7978a", "author": "3334e510d3de5c1d91e4ec6ec97bfea7", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 26, "content": "every persona game is great", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ed7de5e035f655acb02d7e3a6e829788", "author": "737f14151b9b51449d3e6749f5eb36cc", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 186, "content": "Haru Okumura's fat tits.\nThat is all.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ed6f436d52c1587d9c609ebd1e067c9d", "author": "771a8acabea55a6a94f1c91ffc7207c3", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 29023, "content": "goofy, but actually a really good sequel. some great mini character arc conclusions for the thieves, music slaps, and just fun to play through in general ( also to replay on merciless is actually good). sophia and zenkichi are peak additions.

This game is fun. It's a lot of fun. The combat is so much fun, it's fun to go looking for it instead of avoiding the JRPG vanilla Persona 5 which gets tiring after 100 battles of grinding. It also doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, you can ride a skateboard and run over shadows with it. You get to do realtime combat with all-out attacks, follow-ups, one-mores, technicals, persona skills/swapping, baton-passes, etc etc. It's a blast to play. I HIGHLY implore you play the game on Hard for your first run. This game NAILS hard mode so well. Unlike other games that make their higher difficulties bullshit and unfair, this game makes it fair. Not only are the enemies tougher, but so are you. You do more damage as well. Combined with dodging and countering, it makes for a super fun combat experience.\n\nThe story is pretty damn good so far too. It feels like a proper sequel to Persona 5, though any part of the game like the base game does feel a bit more empty / simplified. Keep in mind that this game is a sequel to the vanilla Persona 5, NOT ROYAL. All the characters are the same as ever and enjoyable to watch and interact with. While Confidants/Social-Links are not present, you still get to bond with your friends a good amount not only in combat but in the real-world through events; reminiscent of Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest complaint you'll probably hear from this game are the bugs. The game has this weird tendency to crash whenever you leave/enter the Metaverse. I'm unsure why. You can luckily save a lot in this game, especially right before you load a new area so it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance as long as you save. The game also has a 60fps cap and some poor Anti-Aliasing which I hope will be fixed with a patch. It's not enough to make the experience any less enjoyable, I just hope it's fixed soon because it may be more buggy depending on the hardware.\n\nOverall, very fun game. Definitely worth the price. It's around 50 hours I've seen from other playthroughs. Not too far off from the length of Persona 4. There's a good amount of fan-service here. I highly would not recommend this game if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal yet, as you probably won't have as much of an emotional connection with the characters / plot as you would with. The DLCs aren't very worth it in my opinion, unless you get them from the Deluxe version. The All-Out Attack Pack seems to be relatively worthless, while the Legacy BGM Pack is a bit pricey and only worth it if you're a big Persona fan.

While it certainly draws inspiration from the genre for its core combat, Strikers goes above and beyond in making the game its own, rather than solely adopting the warriors style and nothing else.\n\n[b]The story[/b] follows up several months after the events of the original Persona 5 game. The crew eager for summer vacation discover the metaverse is still active and people are manipulating a new AI program, \"EMMA,\" to steal the desires of those around them for various reasons. They take to the road to sniff out these \"Jails\" and steal back the desires of the public. All in all, the story is pretty fun for what it is, but don't be expecting the same heavy hitting and deeply metaphoric narrative structure Persona 5 had delivered. Strikers definitely reigns it back a bit, and plays out more like a fun action anime tale.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is pretty addictive. Being a fan of warriors games in the first place, I'm naturally drawn to hack 'n slash fun, but Strikers adds many of its own series' elements to the formula to spice things up. First, you are no longer on a day-by-day system when using the metaverse. Rather, you can phase to-and-fro reality as you please to restock and refresh. The fight encounters are similar to the original persona game, but then the hack 'n slash starts. The key factor here, is that you will be fighting basic shadow hordes, but a lot of Personas as well. This means you have to watch out for your own weaknesses and debuffs, but you can use your team's personas to fight against them as well.\n\nPersona registration, fusion, and strengthening are still here, and being able to collect, mix, and level up personas and skills to help you fight different types of enemies is addictive and just fun.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: of course its great I don't even need to say anything.\n\nIf this game lacks anything, its simply being a spinoff means there are no social links, variable dialogue or story options, etc. Its a very linear action game, so besides your personas and equipment the sense of control and planning isn't really there. But this makes sense, as its is a different class of game, mixing in elements from its true form.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of hack 'n slash games to enjoy this. If you love action games with flashy visuals and great music, this is for you. And if you simply LOVE persona 5, this is definitely for you, as the entire existence of Strikers simply stands as fan service for the biggest of fans.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "671f5b7bcd9851098ffa7117dd4d3033", "author": "9351b2b6248956adafb3dd4a4545a802", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 896, "content": "persona people do be striking though good game enjoyed it alot", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6587199847ea5270a2d05ada3d0b9170", "author": "c821b19ba5a05ab3ad25e52130d7c5a3", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 448, "content": "i dont meet the minimum processor for this game so im enjoying my powerpoint\natlus please put persona arena on pc im not only begging im pleading and crying its the only thing i truely want on this platform legally\nbring 2.0 while youre at it", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6130341805d65514a3a460ef641225fe", "author": "e72607d1506856d39e86301e19d50239", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 769, "content": "The combat is good, soundtrack slaps harder than my dads belt when i get a B, and has a lot of personality. 4.5/5    Final verdict: its technically a sequel but i think P5R is better overall.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "60c48e93f9fd517898c80387f060a4a4", "author": "384f9e200e855d7da34a759b1b8df4b4", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2018, "content": "Persona 5 Royal in PC pleaseeeee! c:", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6026f92da31a59599e8dc9c818c53bac", "author": "eacd6837c18b5dcbacb8689686a2dd52", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 540, "content": "This ain't it chief.  \n\nI'll leave a \"positive\" review - but this game is nothing more than simply \"just okay\" \nIt's nice ATLUS is taking PC ports more seriously, but I'd recommend just playing P4 Gold over this.\n\n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5f2e2f163a9555b788813d34a59fe722", "author": "e019f0b874795a73bcfef41f23343a45", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 3614, "content": "A great extension of the phantom thieves story.

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3efaa21899b057ad8f940587006af58f", "author": "bb398d62bcad5781a45bd7cdf63282fb", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 5362, "content": "A very solid game, if you're a fan of Persona 5. The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3eafb9623d755f03ad2cc8ff0d24d9e2", "author": "61460e18433055978ed8aca235e52098", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 92, "content": "So Strikers is basically a sequel to Persona 5. got lost for a second 10/10 still fun though. hopefully ATLAS brings us Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 33, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3e83f422982955388e7275475349d4b2", "author": "9ab7be7f2c95582db7fff9c4349b09c3", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 356, "content": "It's a good game and its fun.

This direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 plays similar to the Warriors type games but there are differences that make it feel much more Persona than I had originally expected. For instance, the story is incredibly prevalent and includes longer scenes as you may be used to from Persona. Weaknesses still play a massive role as well. Where I had originally expected a similar style of combat to Dynasty Warriors, I was pleasantly surprised at the tactical depth of this game; button mashing isn't going to get you very far. I would probably say it's more similar to Kingdom Hearts in that regard.\n\nAfter 40 hours, I can say I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. It's very well stylised and I am happy to be playing it on PC. That being said, I - and as far as I've seen, many others as well - have been experiencing crashes. Make sure to save at every chance you have and you shouldn't ever lose much progress. This still screams for a patch, though.\n\nBesides this, my only annoyance is that the menus are relatively slow to navigate. Again, they're very stylish, but having an animation between every sub-menu makes it a bit tedious sometimes.

The number of times this game crashes is absolutely insane.\nNot to mention, the default controls for the game are terrible with Keyboard and Mouse, making it damn near unplayable without a controller. And the keybind settings are mediocre at best.\n\nGraphical settings wise, the game lacks ultrawide support, which is a huge point against it for me personally. The game ALSO does not apparently support refresh rates above 60Hz (as modders have discovered it is apparently tied to game speed), meaning that I can't take full advantage of my 75Hz monitor. Most games also feature a way to pause when tabbed out, or to keep the game running, which P5S lacks, making some situations annoying (I.E. game pauses when I respond to a friend on discord, etc). Other than that, the game looks beautiful and I haven't had any minor or large graphical glitches yet.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that I'm able to clear up to an hours worth of content, and then the game crashes, making me replay it. Since the game is actually pretty tough on higher difficulties, and grinding isn't really a viable option, this is extremely frustrating. Until these issues are fixed, I CANNOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME. If you would like to support the Devs, purchase the game on another platform. Do NOT reward shitty ports.

The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "14086bc40710572babcb7e2176f46f8c", "author": "f418f05121a950da8838c1d012bf7eec", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 1880, "content": "9/10.

However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 53, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "082f10173b0558e2994ebb6c1b117169", "author": "91906f07fab25fc19e5f14f31491b93f", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 1645, "content": "this game is a bunch of fun", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0457a538436c534cb4e93170159e33f1", "author": "01988e675d315df4a874f19bfbc71027", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2262, "content": "persona 5 royal pls", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "02c30d49b8d85412af3eb31fecbe041f", "author": "59dd071cd1a05c8ba24410f870a63cd7", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 250, "content": "I wish there was an option to rate DLC for a game--the actual game aside, the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game is effectively useless because all the bonus media content is locked behind a Unity app, with no seemingly discernible way or means of extracting it.\n\nThe other portion of the content are essentially in-game items that give you a boost with your abilities and equipment, but is arguably rendered useless within a few hours of playing the game.\n\nSo with both these points in mind--and with early access period now expired, there's effectively no reason to pay an additional $10 for the additional content.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 14, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0185ba6a4e4459258559aa8b3e757efc", "author": "5a64f3e16abe5799bb5cbdceefde2ab0", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 100, "content": "Can they top shooting god in the face on Christmas Eve and getting into a fist fight with your big brother MGS4 style?

Gameplay has no social sim aspect but the transition into action combat was really well done, higher difficulties alleviate the button mashing issue.\n\nI won't deny the story does feel like a rehash of the original Persona 5, but out of bias I'm fond of that familiarity, and some characters that did not get much of a spotlight in the main game such as Haru finally get a moment to shine here. You see way more group interactions in this game and I wish we had more of that in the original. The two new main characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, fit really nicely into the cast without altering the dynamic of the group that much.\n\nGameplay-wise I will admit it is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. The affinity and 1 More system from the series' turn-based combat was translated incredibly well into an action format, but it can still carry that notorious Musou stereotype of just mashing buttons in most normal encounters. For that reason I'd suggest playing on Hard for the best experience since it makes the benefit from exploiting affinities greater.\n\nAlso worth noting the entire social sim aspect from the main games is not here. It's pure dungeon crawling and platforming with the real world only really being used for story purposes and buying items. The Confidant system is replace by a secondary EXP bar named \"BOND\" that works as a sort of skill tree.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ee9f0c7b6da055d2871a5a17278501ba", "author": "42b87807f97456859f61b51bd4d14df3", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 2192, "content": "looks amazing! the animations are super fluid and the cutscenes are so pretty, has one of the best soundtracks in any persona game and amazing gameplay, sadly is a step down story wise from the o original.

[h1] Hoooooo boy [/h1] Props to Omega-Force/Koei Tecmo, and P-Studio for making this game happened, and to Atlus for publishing this game to steam (praise be to Atlus). I will gladly buy any MegaTen related games.\n\nOkay so, I'll make this as concise as possible.\nThe story (although a direct continuation from the base game) is basically a reimagine of Persona 5's with a bunch of changes specifically for this spin-off. I'm just gonna say it follows the same structure, that's it (for those who have played, you'll know what I mean). It actually reminds me of the movie called HER because of how the plot heavily uses artificial intelligence as its main topic. Expect a lot of dialogue since this is still a persona game.\n\nThe gameplay is good no doubt about that, actually great. Who knew that a game that uses the combination between musou combat with persona mechanics would actually work wonders, I never thought it would be this good. Each character you control has different combat style and special ability. It's really the highlight of this spin-off.\n\nProbably the complains I have are the price and possibly, the end game content (I have my doubts on this one though) since when you finish the game, the only replayability value that this game will give you after finishing it are new game+ (you can totally 100% achievement in the 2nd playthrough) and a new difficulty. I really hope Atlus will update this game with new content, although it's unlikely to happen because this game was released in Japan a year ago and (to my knowledge) there had been no update since then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, as expected of Atlus. Even though they really milk this series hard, you can bet the spin offs of each game are done and polished really friggin well.

(Like you can't check side missions in palaces, so you have to get out. You can't shop from anywhere else, but from the base even though you do shopping on your phone. And you can just leave and rejoin jails to regenerate without any penalties)\n-The jails (dungeons) are just a tad bit repetatives in it's objectives.\n\nThat's it.

It's Showtime!\n\nBefore getting into the actual review, you should understand that this is a direct sequel to Persona 5 which is a Playstation exlusive title. \nIf you didnt play the original game or at read the manga or watched the horrible anime adaptation, you propably wont enjoy this game if you give any hsit about story. The game treats use as if you already know what happend, which is nice for people who actually do, but not for you if you have no clue whats going on. \nAlso, I think you will find it hard to care about the characters if youre not familiar with them already, since we spent over 100 hours getting to know them and their quriks, so a scene of them hanging out and having fun is propably pretty boring for somone who doesnt know them. Unless you are somone who just mashes the \"skip button\" as soon as text appears on the screen, go and play Persona 5 Royal first(improved version of P5)\n\nNow for the actual review:\nThis game is an absolute Banger. It really embodies the spirit of a sequel. The story is new and intresting while your previous knowledge is still helpful. The Dynasty Warrior gameplay combined with the Persona 5s unique style could have turned around really messy but they NAILED it! I have a lot of respect for creating a fun action RPG that still feels like Persona. You will still find yourself scrolling through your Persona skills to exploit your enemies weakness, All-out attacking and batton passing but now you can dash around and do cool combos and use your surroundings to your advantage. I think it goes wothout saying that all of this looks amazing, as expected for Persona 5. \nThere is a good mixture of new music that bangs just as hard as the first soundtrack and old tracks (remixed or not) that make the game sound familiar. \n\nThe game only crashed only once on me in 14 hours of gameplay, which really isnt a big deal.

I decided to play with a keyboard just to get the default experience. Their is a lack of multiple aspects from the original persona 5 that I wish were here, but this is a spin off game after all. The game plays well enough, their is a few minor odd things that happen (that may happen on console as well) but it isn't anything game breaking. The one thing that really makes me upset is when I alt tab, and go back into the game the dodge button (alt) will start making windows noises if you press it over and over again. (and you'll basically be using dodge alot). I hope to see more persona ports on steam! These games are great, and I'd love nothing more than to play them here, even if their are issues.

If you plan to play this game and haven't played Persona 5 (Vanilla or Royal), this may give away some spoilers from them and you may lose context on certain things. \n\nGame is real fun. Combat is typical of Musou/Warriors games with the Persona style twist. The new characters are amazing. A several scenes alone (if you had played P5 prior) remind you why you loved Persona in the first place. \n\nOn the technical side of things. In the beginning of the game there are a few issues with audio. Mainly on the English dub end. Characters sound lower in several sections of dialogue. For example Yusuke, sounds lower than the rest of the group in the first few scenes of the game. I think that's due to the situation the English cast and crew were placed in mixing audio because of COVID\n\nSecond, some stuttering issues at 60fps on 3D cutscenes at times. I'm on windowed mode. Haven't checked at full screen and/or 30fps.\n\nThirdly, I have experienced I believe one or two crashes already. This was on windowed mode too.

I'm not sure why; to make things worse, the checkpoints to save the game are quite far in between so uhh, the anxiety of hoping the game won't crash while you're far away from a save point is stressful. So if you're playing, remember to save as many times as possible. Redoing what you did from the past 3 hours is not fun. \n\nAnyways, Persona 5 Strikers is a nice sequel for fans of Persona 5 (Royal). However, the combat is a musou-type game, being completely different from Persona 5's turn based combat. Although, it is very interesting to see how they incorporated hack and slash with the tactical use of personas & baton passes.\n\nThe overworld exploration is satisfying, being able to walk around Shibuya, Sapporo, Osaka, and so on with your pals is a nice feeling. \n\nOne thing to note is how the new Velvet Room functions. With the removal of social links, you can't get bonus exp for your personas from social links. Instead you can level up your personas through the use of PPs (Persona Points) which is a little disappointing but it's fine.\n\nTo further explain on the removal of social links, Persona 5 Strikers introduces a mechanic called Bonds to replace it. With bonds, you may unlock certain bonus perks like \"Extra Money Dropped Per Battle\" & so on. You can get bond points from playing through the game.\n\nIt's a game to play if you're interested to see what's up with the Phantom Friends after the first game. Not so for the depth of the combat/gameplay, Persona 5 (Royal) still triumphs on that part. \n\nSome mechanics from the first game were revamped or changed to be better/worse.

[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers (P5S) is best enjoyed if you played Persona 5 (P5) as it is best described as an amplified P5. The character quirks are more prevalent, the humour is more prevalent, many of the reused songs of P5 got more intense, and whether intentional or not the dialogue got A LOT more fellow-kiddy which only adds to the hilarity of it all.\n\nMuch of the music originates from P5 but they are complimented by just as many new songs for the new shop, activities, fights and metaverse locations so this is as solid as you would expect it with an added increased variety in music genres.\n\nFinally, while mementos do not exist anymore, the game has its own grinding mechanic affiliated with new requests awarding much more interesting rewards than the simple XP and money of memento requests of P5.\n\n\n[h1] ...yet also losing some of its original charm [/h1]\n\nThe social gameplay feels like a P5 lite with some systems absent, most notably the time management of activities, the levelling of social stats and the school in-class questions and exams. The absence of those systems also leads to a poorer diversity in world activities with shopping being the only real activity left. Even then, the majority of shopping is done in an all-in-one online shop with magic instant delivery (the game fails to provide a legitimate explanation for this although it tries to). It is a bit disheartening, but the new shop UI and song make up for it to some degree.\n\nCooking becomes a much more important part of the game, becoming more diverse and more invested with you being encouraged to scour all shops to find new recipes and ingredients and now contributes to the bond system replacing the P5 confidants.\n\nThe bond system allows for a certain level of customisation of your experience as instead of linear confidant progression, you can invest your skill points however you want, specialising in certain areas in the order that you want. \nThe bond progression is also more gameplay inclined, progressing as you play like a glorified XP bar, and while friends will give you missions to somewhat enrich their personality, those will have a much stronger \u201cRPG side quest\u201d flair to them rather than the personality or story focus of P5\u2019s confidant system.\nHowever, the gang evolves as a complete group more often and with significantly more voice acting than P5, you get to see a lot more chemistry between the different members than you did in the previous game.\n\n\n[h1] Combat, a successful conversion that stays true to its origins [/h1]\n\nMaking up for the less diverse real world, the metaverse has gotten an upgrade with a more vertical level design and Joker having gotten a lot more agile. Many more objects can be jumped on and off from but can also be interacted with in unique ways which will tie directly into combat.\n\nAnd combat is the biggest change of this game, switching from turn based to a hack and slash which is, overall, a success. Everything you learnt from P5 is still here: personas, all out attacks, knock downs, elemental affinities and weaknesses, gun special attacks and the new animations, combat sounds and of course the UI are all satisfying and switching between powers, combos and characters is as smooth as can be.\n\nThe system can feel overwhelming at first to someone new to Persona as you are being given access to the full cast of P5 right from the start which is a lot of combos and a lot of persona powers to learn.\nOnce you figure it out non-boss enemies will very quickly fall into the \"one shot combo\" area which can make the game feel a bit repetitive and/or grindy; something P5 already suffered from but P5S is at least a lot faster to switch in and out of combat.\n\nHowever, while you will be facing several dozens of enemies at once quite early on leading to a lot of visual mess (albeit good looking mess), the game remains fairly forgiving and will let you get through a few levels with simple X and RT smashing while you figure out your combos.\n\nAfterwards, the game will nevertheless throw significantly more mini-bosses your way than P5 did which makes for more interesting combat; although the danger of those mini-bosses is damaged by the leniency of the game. Indeed, saving spots have become much more abundant than they were in P5 and without the time management component, the game encourages the player to jump in and out of the metaverse to get a complete free recharge of HP and SP before teleporting back to the save spot with no downsides whatsoever, making the game devoid of resource management if one makes use of this mechanic. \n\nMaster Arts are a new system in P5S which are awarded for directly playing a character. After playing a character for a sufficient amount of time additional combos are unlocked and that amount of time is arguably too little. However, it is an interesting mechanic to reward players for sticking to a character with some additional toys.\n\nFinally, the bosses. Transforming turn-based boss mechanics into hack and slash mechanics is no easy task and P5S does not really succeed at it...or maybe it chose not to and that's a good thing.\nBosses go through different moves and phases and the ideal strategy is often to learn their sequence of action, wait for the sequence to end, exploit their weakness, and blow your combos during their break between two sequences and repeat. This is in essence a turn-based system, except you get to press the dodge button to avoid damage during the boss' \"turn\".\nIt's however not a bad system, bosses in P5 were very enjoyable and they are just as enjoyable if not more in P5S. While they get away from the hack and slash fast paced power fantasy and fall more into a the calmer strategically turn-based realm of things, this change of pace in combat approach is most welcome and still manages to capitalise on some of the new aspects of the combat.\n\n\n[h1] A great sequel yet a questionable first release [/h1]\n\nOverall P5S is a great game for people who wanted straightforward easy fun with more of the P5 characters' personalities and interactions with some extra new gameplay ideas which all work well. \nHowever, with the removal of much of what made P5 such a unique and interesting adventure, P5S fails to exceed its predecessor, although it also does not feel like it is trying to and is content with being, in essence, a high-quality expansion.\nWhile newcomers to Persona or Persona 5 might be able to enjoy P5S as a standalone, the game is unquestionably a better experience by having played the original Persona 5 which makes the release of this game on steam before a potential Persona 5 Royal port questionable at best.\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "15d1a14ed3a65574999ce1e8e0ae9765", "author": "8303555ef52856a9ba47d87cdda44b09", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 270, "content": "This game made me mentally ejaculate on three occasions", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "15898b2afa5a5c2391d9d880657483a4", "author": "69deb3d86db25b3e8b0f0d814a7839bf", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1348, "content": "For someone that's never played a Persona game in my life, this one is pretty decent. The RPG hack 'n slash feels much better than the turn based gameplay that the others have, which is the only reason I bought and played this. However after 20 hours of gameplay I feel like the fun is over, the story is good to an extent, go and rescue people from being brainwashed, yada yada. But that's the extent of the story and gameplay. \n\nI also feel like the everything revolves around the gameplay rather than story. Up to the third dungeon you are doing the same thing you have been doing for the previous two, maybe it's just me but going and getting [x] but you have to do [y] before being able to do [x] three times over seems monotonous and boring. There's nothing unique that changes in the dungeons that makes those aspects better, it's just the same gameplay loop and I personally got bored of doing the same thing to go onto the same thing again, but in a different area with different enemies. \n\nAs I stated previously with the game feeling like it revolves around doing the same thing to progress the story. It would've been better for me if to progress the story you wouldn't have to do the same thing you did in the last dungeon, but it was a bit different. Instead of go to three bird cages, fight mini boss, which then allows you to fight the actual boss, there could've been other ways to lead up to the final boss fight, such as puzzles, or do some task that isn't in the metaverse that unlocks a path to [x] that helps you get to the boss. \n\nThe gameplay however is good, being able to create persona's, you have bonds/ skill tree, different characters you can play as e.t.c, it's very fun. I enjoyed playing as much as I did, but after doing the same thing for the third time, it just felt repetitive and less engaging because you already knew what you had to do,  you already knew what was going to happen. But hey, maybe that's the whole point. I just didn't enjoy that aspect.\n\n---\n\nAfter being told that the game actually gets good after the third dungeon I decided that I would give the game one last shot and well finish it, I can say for sure that I was not disappointed. Albeit what I said previously and parts of that review still holding up, the game is spectacular. Gameplay does get better after the third dungeon and it is a great story driven game, apart from spending most of it with dialogue, cut-scenes, etc. But that might just be the point of a story game. \n\nSome things I wanted to address though is the frequent random crashes and the inconsistency between cut scenes.\n\nFirstly crashes, this game has crashed *a lot* for me and when I say a lot, I mean hoping for the best the game doesn't crash when you're on the last boss fight, all items used up, 2 team mates down and hoping it doesn't just seize up and tell you \"no\". I say this because it has happened to me at the end of boss fights where you finish a boss off, goes to a white screen, then the game crashes, very infuriating and needs fixing. \n\nSecondly, the cut scenes and dialogue are just inconsistent. I don't know why it's necessary for 3 types of ways to display something happening, you have the first way of just showing it via the just dialogue bars and the characters talking, you either have to progress by clicking or having it automatically do it, then there's it being rendered in the engine and an actual cut scene AND THEN there's it being an actual animation. What. The. F*&k. There are some parts in the game where it will progress in the order and it just doesn't make sense, just show me it in one way! \n\nBut those are just some nit-picks. Great game though and introduction to the series, at least for me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "144c73226b135001831f2b2dc032b049", "author": "63a959d6ef66516e9bd6264496bf62bc", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 293, "content": "very nice i like", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "135abe7e46ef5aa9b1791aec26a0c788", "author": "c18268f5d50b528eb61cbb90b518a9b4", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 422, "content": "Combat is good and more of a challenge then I thought\nStory and characters are obviously to die for\nIf I could speak directly to ATLUS...PLEASE PUT MORE PERSONA GAMES ON PC", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "113f896cda7d592cae74808130dc9692", "author": "290a6ceec239502ea3c7b0eda07365cc", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1435, "content": "If you are a Persona fan this is a must buy, especially if you really enjoyed Persona 5 and it's characters, it picks up 5 months after the end of Persona 5 and it does a great job at making you feel right at home when you start it up, it goes from it's turn based strategy gameplay to a more hack and slash action game, the combat is fun, the characters all have new and amazing outfits and the story is back to what you're used to...changing hearts as the Phantom Thieves!\n\nCouple of downsides imo but not really a big deal...there is no Kasumi, this does not follow the path of P5R it goes off vanilla P5, there are also no social links but it does have a new thing called a bond system which is kinda like it?

For any newcomers on Steam looking to enter the Persona series, I do not recommend this game as an entry point. The game assumes that you've played Persona 5 and understand the group's dynamics and past because it does not explain it to you and constantly references the OG Persona 5 game. So this is a review of Strikers from a fan of Persona 5 instead of a newcomer.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe Phantom Thieves goes on a trip around Japan! Strikers does a great job in giving the player more group interactions and is also an excellent tourism advertisement for Japan. Not much to say here without spoiling the story, but any Persona fan who wants to see more Phantom Thieves will get their money's worth.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the part you're probably looking for. The collaboration between Omega Force and P-Studio brings the Warriors gameplay to Strikers. However, unlike Hyrule Warriors, this game does not utilize the same overall gameplay as the Warriors series. You will not be going around a big map fighting generals with your army. Instead, Strikers plays [b] exactly [/b] like Persona 5, but it's now an Action RPG. You navigate the map similar to Persona 5, slowly approaching enemies to ambush them. Using Personas, you target weakness to down your enemies and execute an All-Out Attack. Show Time also makes its return from Royal. This core gameplay loop will be familiar but now it's cooler and more fast-paced because it has action elements in it. If you love the gameplay in Persona 5, you won't have a problem here.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nBecause it's an Action game now, the Strikers remixes have more electric guitars in it and sounds 10x more energetic. It's amazing. I'm listening to it on repeat already. If you love the Persona 5 OST, you can add the new songs into your playlist and jam out even more.\n\n[h1] PC Port [/h1]\nThe PC port is pretty average. Nothing significant to note of its settings; it's the same settings you expect from a typical PC game. The game also caps at 60fps, so no unlimited/120/144 fps. One important thing to note is that this game does experience some random crashes when loading a new area/going into another menu, based on mine and my friends' experiences. Save often to ensure you don't lose much progress when one does eventually happen.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is definitely a game you will want to play as a Persona 5 fan. By no means is this some insignificant spin-off, it's a sequel that Persona fans will want to play like how Royal is. I'm happy that Atlus (probably with help from KT and Omega Force) decided to put this game on PC and I hope that it's a continuous sign of more Persona games coming to PC. Also, after finishing this game, if this game gave ideas to P-Studio to make future games as Action RPGs, I'm [b] all for it [/b].

You will struggle with this game if you button mash, which I like. It \nmakes you learn when to use certain skills and when to use just the character's base attacks.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReplay Value: Great replay value for 100% completionist and people who want to do Merciless Difficulty. (i'm doing that rn and it's really fun so far! Just make sure you prepare for it before going in.)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPost-Game: Persona 5 Strikers can offer around 5-10 hours of post game content before NG+ is unlocked, and I actually really like it, it gave me something to do even after you beat the Final Boss. The post game can challenge your skills with the game so far and really put you up to test with some of the content they give you during post-game.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPC Port: This PC port is not great at all, through out my 55+ hours of this game, the game crashed many times and even set me back 3 hours one time. It could've been much much worse, but could've been so much better. I think Atlus should work on this field alot more in upcoming PC Ports of their games.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion: Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to Persona 5 and continues great story telling even if feeling slow at times with some pacing issues in the Jails. It also offer a lot after you beat the game like, a new difficulty, Merciless, a Post-Game that keeps you playing and improving your abilities, and overall is a great experience for those who have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.

Strikers has a very strange sense of 'balance', where most random encounters can be solved in a single hit by ambushing the enemy and immediately going into an all-out attack that just clears the screen. About the only time you'll ever get hit is if you don't pull off an ambush - which is common because the \"ambush\" button is the same as the \"power attack\" button and so half the time you'll wind up shooting the enemy instead of ambushing. You also more or less lose the ability to ambush enemies from behind: you pretty much have to be in a hiding spot and the range from which you can ambush enemies from a hiding spot is greatly reduced from what it is in Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nThen you have the boss fights, in which all sense of balance goes out the window. Most bosses can and will kill your party in one or two hits even if you're the appropriate level to be fighting them, and the party member AI is simply not equipped to deal with them. For me, most of the boss fights consisted of having my entire party die immediately followed by me taking control of whoever was left and alternating between mashing the dodge button and getting in one or two physical attacks before repeating the process.\n\nGone is the ability to creatively use spells or Persona fusion to address the difficulty: spells cost several times what they do in Persona 5 and your party members have less than a quarter of the SP they normally would have. The idea is that you're supposed to do attack chains that end in your Persona casting a weaker version of a spell for free.. except there's no easy way to control which spell it casts if it has more than one. I believe it's based on the number of times you hit the light attack button before hitting special attack, but it seems random to me.\n\nFusion is also significantly nerfed - there are fewer Personas in the game and a lot of them have been nerfed to the ground from P5 or Royal. There's no opportunity to get creative with fusion the way there is in the real game, where you can make a Persona specifically to address certain situations.. meaning that there will be situations where you simply do not have an answer to what the game is presenting you with. \n\nThe game tries to address this by giving you frequent save points, from which you can go through multiple loading screens to recover your HP and SP by leaving for the real world from the dungeon and then coming back.. instead of having, I dunno, a button that you can just press at the save point. Considering that you can use maybe three heals on a full SP bar (and each one heals maybe a third of your HP) this means you'll be seeing load screens a lot.\n\nThen there's the frequent issues linked to this game's poor implementation of Denuvo: random crashes, hanging on loading screens, slowdowns and frame lag. \n\nGive this one a pass until it's on deep discount.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5b240dff5c225ec7888853035521ad2e", "author": "4f42eddb5ff856a4a8c40a09e60b33fc", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 371, "content": "This doesn't feel like a Musou game with a light coating of Persona paint. \n\nThis feels like a Persona game with a light coating of Musou. \n\nThis is a good thing.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5b023dfacf815fb3beb87db2e9e9e69e", "author": "535deb9c14775d0b83f83a775c5e6b8b", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 498, "content": "I use a all-in-one computer, purchased around last year September from HP, but it's Intel CORE I3 10th Gen and playing Persona is definitely fine with this computer, just change some settings with display and graphics and you should be able to play with this smoothly. \n\nI extremely recommend this game to Persona fans.

As such there's zero instance of the archana system for fusing Personas and the strategy behind it. There is also no real time constraints like in P5/R (which might be very welcome to a lot of people, I get it).

The soundtrack is great like usual.\n\nAll this being said, even though I'm disappointed in some aspects of the game, it's still very enjoyable so far for the genre it's in.

It's not amazing, but it is great. I am not a fan of the dynasty warriors type of game play usually, however this game re-imagines that concept with the different characters and abilities in a way similar to Hyrule Warriors. The story and characters are just as lovable as they are in Persona 5. A small issue that many people have with this game is the lack of social links and confidants seen in previous entries in the series, but this game makes up for it in its fast game play. This game is not the same game as Persona 5, it's its own game. The fact that you can exit and re-enter the jail to fully replenish your health and sp on the same day without being forced to sleep is a great part of this game and the jails are absolutely massive. You're given access to almost all the characters right out of the gate and introduced to both of the new members of the group very quickly. At the moment, I am close to completing the first jail and am thoroughly enjoying the fights and have yet to feel the fights as tedious. The boss fights are especially fun as they require you to use a little bit more strategy instead of just spamming X X X X X Y. \nOverall at the moment, I give this game my rating of a:\n8.5/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "28fdc641c4a752e8847792ebb7e0545f", "author": "f8df5bce982e5782a02930916a108ab1", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 899, "content": "love the theme and the combat is astounding", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "25929bfcd9a05e2b8aeb42b1c48f47f1", "author": "159b8f7a25c05bb9b549fc5942ef9d29", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 3054, "content": "A fantastic game and a brilliant followup to Persona 5. By far the best Persona spinoff we've had yet.\n\nThe fusion of Persona with Warrior style gameplay works great, the presentation genuinely makes you feel like you're playing a mainline title, except it's an Action RPG instead of a Turn-based one.\n\nThe story is very similar to Persona 5's, but with enough differences and additions to make it feel like a fresh experience. Definitely not as deep as some other Persona stories, but still a good one.\n\nI played on Hard difficulty, and battles rarely felt \"tedious\" or \"boring\" like a lot of people often accuse Warrior games of being (the only real exceptions being some optional bosses which act a little too much like HP sponges for my liking). I did find the difficulty jumped around a bit for certain bosses, where the boss of the semi-final dungeon was brutal to defeat, yet the final boss itself was a complete joke.\n\nThe music is, as you'd expect from a Persona game, absolutely fantastic. Lyn Inaizumi returns to sing for an almost entirely new soundtrack, as well as doing some Warrior's style \"Rock\" remixes of Persona 5 music (\"Last Surprise\" and \"Rivers in the Desert\").\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly stellar or anything, but they work well enough for what the game is going for (considering this games is also on the Switch). The art direction is as amazing a P5's was.\n\nApart from some HP sponge bosses and some occasionally crusty visuals, my only other complaint with this specific port is that I experienced quite a few crashes while playing. These usually occurred after long play sessions and weren't super often or anything, but still very annoying when they occurred and can potentially lose you a lot of unsaved progress.\n\nI'd also say I'd HEAVILY recommend playing the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this, as there's numerous characters and references to them that first time Persona fans wouldn't understand.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a solid 8/10. It's fantastic experience that Persona 5 fans will love, despite some difficulty and crashing issues. I hope we start seeing more Persona games being ported to other platforms now, specifically Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 FES (hopefully a remake for the latter!).", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "24bc6423693b5c23840fde6505af151a", "author": "159c3498e5435933b40979452b2956ff", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1779, "content": "very fun and great sequel to P5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "23edfa6b8d3e5548800d6ef24fa83034", "author": "e6686c733e265149bf44d27f3c121ea6", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 287, "content": "I'll keep this short: great set of characters, great story, fantastic GUI design.

However, I can't recommend this game because I just don't think it's very good on its own. I will probably play it to completion, but not because I think it's actually worth my time.\n\nThere's a scene early on where the old crew goes to the old hangout at their school and one comments about how it hasn't been that long, but they still feel a sense of nostalgia and I think that sentiment just about sums it up. I enjoy P5S only so much in that it reminds me of a game I rather enjoyed more and would likely have more fun replaying than honoring it in a sequel/spinnoff. P5S is weaker in just about every way. The story is rushed, the villains lack any depth, there is no buildup to the events that occur, and both dungeon crawling and combat have baffling design choices.\n\nKoei Techmo appear to have sort of mashed the Dynasty Warrior and Persona engines together, though one is custom and the other based on Unity. Combat plays like a DW game, but you are a team of four and enemies have the abilities and effects of Persona, at least for the most part, and theoretically this should work. One problem is that all the magic is range-based and so if you're attacked, it's usually from off-screen, and even weak enemies can have powerful effects. I spent an hour on one encounter because I had to fight alone and Pixies kept casting zio (lightning bolt) which caused stun and the duration was long enough for other enemies to punch me from full health to zero. I eventually learned that hit and run is the only way to survive.\n\nI am not a DW fan, but the combat just doesn't feel right in other ways, too. The camera is slow, controls sluggish, visuals to chaotic to be easily readable while being swarmed, you deal very little damage, and you're constantly switching between different characters with different control priorities and play styles. This could work if switching were seamless like Marvel vs Capcom, but it's not, or if each character was deep like and interesting enough for their own game like DMC5, which they aren't. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to say the combat is terrible, it's just not great. It's not a refinement of a good idea, nor a remarkable innovation. Okay, passable, not great.\n\nDungeon crawling is passable, functioning like in P5 with pseudo-stealth mechanics and platforming, though is mostly held back by long load times, even on my SSD. Whenever you find a checkpoint, you should leave the dungeon to heal up and immediately return and the only reason you won't is the loading screen on exit and reentry, even though each scene is fairly small and constantly reuses assets. This almost feels intentional because otherwise they could have made checkpoints heal you and you'd never have reason to leave the dungeon.\n\nFinally, the story: I won't go into what it's about too much because I routinely finding myself lose focus as dialogue flies by without developing much. The story is a thin wrapper around finding excuses to throw the team into dungeons and go on a road trip to find more dungeons. Learn that bad person exists, go to their dungeon, get blocked, defeat a mini boss, go back and defeat the real boss. Same formula as P5, just a lot more trimmed down. It also all takes place over a summer vacation road trip so you don't have any worries aside from someone being a bad person.\n\nVerdict: P5S is a toned down imitation of P5 that at times feels lovingly crafted, but mostly just a cynical cash grab made for fans and only fans.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1b87eb23a4de532491aab083422c2014", "author": "4e381790823e57f08ba86dd4754957f8", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 753, "content": "Not as content-rich as Persona 5 Royal, or even the original Persona 5, which is frankly to be expected with a spinoff. The roster of available personas is rather small, the game basically tells you what to do and prevents you from doing anything else, and the social link/confidant system present in the main series is replaced with a watered-down bond system. However, the flair of Persona 5 remains, and it's very flashy, especially with the hack-and-slash gameplay. All-Out Attacks, Showtimes, and the series's signature \"persona eyes\" all add to this game's style, without the need for much graphical power, allowing this game to run on lower-end or older gaming PCs. Fair warning: the plot will not make a lot of sense without the context of Persona 5. As I do not have a PS4, I watched a let's play of the game instead (I am told the anime sucks). If you have a PS4, or are one of the lucky ones to get your hands on a PS5, I recommend you play Persona 5/P5R first, otherwise you won't have context. It is unfortunate that P5 or P5R are unavailable on Steam, but it is understandable if Atlus signed an exclusivity agreement with Sony.

While it may look like a simple Dynasty Warriors clone with a Persona skin, the reality is that this game has a LOT of depth behind it.\n\nThe action-based combat retains a lot of the systems at play in P5 and P5R - elemental weaknesses, technical attacks, status moves, buffing and debuffing, 1-More attacks, All Out Attacks, Baton Passes - you name it and Strikers has most likely implemented it in some fashion. In addition to the core systems, each character feels fantastic to play - each boasting unique movesets, abilities and progression paths, as well as displaying a lot of their personality in their fighting style. To put it simply, there's a lot more to the combat than meets the eye, and those who have previously played the original Persona 5 or Royal will appreciate the small details here.\n\nThe story so far (around 16 hours in) feels very lively thanks to the strong returning cast of characters as well as the two great new additions, Sophia and Zenkichi. The English version brings more fantastic performances which give the game a unique charm, and while the stakes don't feel too high at the moment, the relationships these characters have with each other make each moment feel endearing.\n\nThe music, my god the music. Straight up bangers everywhere. Do yourself a favour and listen to one of the new battle themes, Daredevil. If that doesn't get you excited to beat up some demons, I don't know what will.\n\nA caveat I will mention and the one gripe I have with the game do far is that ultimately it is a sequel, meaning it's difficult to recommend to new players who didn't experience the original game. You could probably enjoy Strikers by reading a synopsis of P5's plot and characters, but really you would just be doing yourself a disservice. As great as I've found Strikers as a massive fan of its predecessor, the lack of a PC port of the original makes it a very hard sell.\n\nIf you're willing to look past that, or you've already a fan who has played P5 / P5R, you will most likely fall in love with the Phantom Thieves all over again in Strikers.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "106e4fa1bb1d53ec885dbc1e2e8d3791", "author": "44d5e45811025eb7a5f6b42a8b59446e", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 627, "content": "So far, I'm having a blast.

I change it the instant i am possible to.

Since Persona 5 is a complete game of its own, there are no major plot points that you need to know to play the game. However, you need to know the major characters from Persona 5 to be able to enjoy Persona 5 Strikers. If you have not watched or played Persona 5, please at least read the wiki pages on all the playable characters.\n\nSecond, the combat changes drastically from Persona 5 (turn-based RPG) to hack-and-slash (specifically Warrior/Musou style aka the Omega-Force style). Check out the gameplay video if you don't know what this means. Most other major Persona gameplay mechanics remain the same (protag wild card personas, level up, etc).\n\nIf you've read up to here and you're okay with everything I've said so far, this is THE GAME for you. \n\nThis game is basically everything you love about Persona 5 on steroid. This game sets during the Summer right after Persona 5 ended. You'd get to see how characters you loved from Persona 5 grow, how they use what they've learned to help people as the Phantom Thieves. One thing that I think Persona 4 did better than Persona 5 is the character development, but Persona 5 Strikers easily outrank Persona 4 on this front (partially because all characters are available and interacting since the beginning of the game).", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f43cc4755d7f593994dc2915e2401e08", "author": "784ce76d84715ceea277c5f18fa0d1b5", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 470, "content": "FOR REAL!?\n\n\nAnyway, this game plays great and I was genuinely surprised by how well they translated the original mechanics into a hack and slash format.

Even though p5 is getting milked to all hell, you can tell that they put the effort and made a great game which recaptures the vibe of the original while still being completely different.

But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus ! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker!

If you have played and enjoyed Persona 5 you will want to play this. The story feels like a worthy Persona 5 sequel and the gameplay is the perfect mix of action and Persona gameplay. The combat does for Persona what FF7 Remake does for FF7.\n\nThe game is not without it's technical bugs which will hopefully be ironed out. I had multiple crashes and consistent freezes when zoning into one of the dungeons which needed to be waited out to continue. I was more than willing to overlook these issues and power through as the game is just really good and hard to put down.\n\nIf you haven't played Persona 5 However I would recommend holding off on playing this until you have. (Hopefully Persona 5 sees a Steam release at some point. Please Sega) The story does very little to explain what happened in the previous game as it presumes you already know the events. Which is a good and bad things as this doesn't really spoil the story of the original too much if you were to play this first, but might leave Strikers only players confused about what/who is being referenced at times. \n\nThis is a must play for Persona 5 players and for everyone else play both.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ef02002a8e4a5599938c9e62bd166fb9", "author": "c11fe6b669d251a48973ae6611d58e43", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 609, "content": "This is a direct story sequel to Persona 5.

The charm and style of Persona is dominant and is present in everything. If you enjoyed the cast and story of P5, but not the combat, i would 100% recommend this as it truly feels like a P5 sequel with action combat and no social management (but don't worry, you'll spend plenty of time in running around, in cut scenes and story beats with your crew. \n\nOverall, as a huge fan of P5, this is a must. The combat is fast pace and refreshing and absolutely captures the essence of the original game. I wish it did have some social stuff but as a spin off, it's fine as is. \n\nMy one slight negative is that if you never played P5 or watched the story, they don't really explain much and it does jump right in after the events of P5 so new players, be aware that some of the game kinda expect you to know what previously happened. \n\nOn the technical side, i'm playing on an ultra-wide monitor at 3440x1440 with a 2080ti and the performance is flawless. constant 75+ fps.

But I don't own any console and wanted to experience. So when P5S was announced I was very much excited, then I come to know that it will be pretty different experience than mainline series with hack and slash gameplay but with characters of P5. I was in a doubt whether I will enjoy this or not because of lack of connections with the lore + characters from the P5. But still I went for it.\nNow the question is did I enjoy this? \nYes, absolutely (to my surprise!)\nCharacters are introduced in a way you get a chance to know about them and chemistry between them (yes, it won't match the connection you might have if played P5 but still its serviceable)\nGameplay is fun and will keep you playing.\nOne big con for the port is that it's unstable as hell (I played early access version so it might not reflect the product on release day) as I experienced multiple crashes when changing between the locations. [This problem has bigger consequence because the game doesn't have autosave system and you can only save at particular locations. So, there is a chance that you might lose large chunk of progress, thus I advise you to save frequently.)\nSo to conclude, I am enjoying the game. Yes, I would have enjoyed it more if (1) I didn't face so many crashes and (2) had played Persona 5.\nSo I do recommend this game to anyone who has played the previous game, but if you haven't I suggest you go with an open mind and you might enjoy the company of the Phantom Thieves.\n\u00a0\nPS- Please ATLUS, don't leave players like me hanging, and give us a PC port of Persona 5 Royal.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ddd9dd233eff59838259bee028f0b27f", "author": "9b340413df0159b09e93250460b8b2a5", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1578, "content": "Worth it for Makoto alone", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dd09ffa848845945b25d75dea374f20c", "author": "2a98adb2dc6c5c138a94be6ef097299e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 686, "content": "The Phantom Thieves are back, baby.

Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now.

The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 26, "funny": 3, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d7dba365d342592ab936390fa8bbace4", "author": "38d2bfcb96225dd8876c1585ed7f5242", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3169, "content": "The games is really good, if you liked the previous persona titles you will enjoy this more.

If you have not played the original you will be missing out a lot in the experience, some stuff straight up won't make sense (Hopefully someday Atlus releases the original to PC as well).\n\nAlthough not as long as the first instalment, P5S's story involves the Phantom Thieves taking a road trip all over Japan. This new setting really allowed the developers to expand more on the world of the Persona franchise with many hints to previous games (Haha Hotspring incident). The story is told incredibly well and is a nice change of pace avoiding rehashing the first games plot too much. \n\nFun Fact:\nFunnily enough, this exact concept is what the original Persona 5 developers wanted for the first game although it was scraped due to inappropriate timing alongside real world events (Great East Japan Earthquake).\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nAs the game was made in combination with ATLUS and Omega Force (The company behind the Warrior fighting games such as Dynasty Warriors, Hyrule Warriors etc) The gameplay is [b] very [/b] different to any other Persona game in the franchise. Instead of the same turn based combat found across the series, you are instead greeted to Warriors-Styled Hack&Slash gameplay which pairs extremely well with Personas core concepts. I would be confident saying the combat style rivals the turn based nature of the other games in the franchise, although it sometimes can feel pretty messy with everything happening at once cluttering up your screen. It is certainly a tonne of fun though.\n\nIn future I would honestly be down to see a full Persona game adopting this fighting style again. Of course keep the turn based combats for the main releases, however if Omega Force wants to partner with ATLUS for another Persona/Warriors game, I'm most certainly down.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nHoly fuck, the music in this game is amazing. P5S basically takes the original P5's soundtrack and mixes it with more upbeat styles to fit the more quickened gameplay, with heaps of rock elements added alongside. \n\nIt would be a sin against this game to not give the soundtrack a perfect score as a minimum, Its that good. \n\n[u]Wrapping it Up:[/u]\nAs stated above, I really don't want to go too deep into the story elements as this game is still very new.

And the dungeons have also been simplified to match the new gameplay style, while retaining jokers ability to switch persona on the fly and some element of party management and group control / move selection in order to retain the persona series feeling, however has ripped away the confidant system to be replaced by \"bonds\", which are upgrade-able by the player at any point, each providing its own unique buff. \n\nThe game does try to introduce new ideas like this, however the concept is still the same as in previous games with antagonists becoming corrupted enough to create their own alternate reality. However there's a slight change here which allows the Jail Monarch to control people in the real world, forcing the Phantom Thieves to travel around Japan to stop them.\n\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers isn\u2019t as compelling or thought provoking as its predecessors, yet the game is filled with fan service, and numerous references to the characters backstories and events from previous games, which for fans of the series is excellent and not forced, however for newcomers to the series will be just a tad confusing as none of them are explained. \n\nIt looks amazing retaining its slick punchy style and surreal colour schemes, each cutscene and special move have been choreographed carefully to capture each character's personality. In this regard Strikers still feels very much like a Persona game and hasn\u2019t lost any of its charm, with voice acting to match, it's hard to call this a spin-off, clearly time and effort was taken with this rather than just being a money grab. \n\nOverall, although it's shifted from its winning JRPG formula, the gameplay, narrative, story line and combat are all well worth playing through the 30 (ish) hour campaign for, however only for fans of the series, i'd generally say this is an awful entry point for new players, and to pick up p4 and p5 first.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cc3524287a7b5ceba99277f19c4b6ecb", "author": "36a3f622ce5a54f4a8061a906436619f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2317, "content": "ryuji and yusuke have a soda drinking contest at the end of the game. kino.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cb04d600601a51b08c6aa897ab9795c9", "author": "39848dabe61353629c4dc6209d4879b2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 496, "content": "Anything Persona 5 related is a win for me.\n\nP.S Ann best girl", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cafee52a154d5239ab2977e8cf95dc56", "author": "1a164852f561553cbb3f0b8ee954f805", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 185, "content": "Great game, I am back to simping for Futaba", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cae5409d6f715ad8a130adcdbe066ce4", "author": "9ed5cedbdea75e0c8b1260a7af68af91", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 620, "content": "very nice, now give us persona 5 golden", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 5, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c9dedbc894ba54669f94e37ec505393a", "author": "4d6f4c3f2b00584aa24db17c0f692872", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 580, "content": "Easy recommendation for any Persona fan or if you enjoy beat 'em up style games.

The dungeon crawling feels a lot \"stiff\" compared to its JRPG counter part. The camera is very very hard to deal with in tight spaces as well. \n\nPeople might be turned off by the fact that this IS a musou game, but the mix with Persona 5's JRPG elements make it so that enemies are not free roaming for you to bash mindlessly, and that enemies are actually more so just encounters you stumble upon. The Persona summons are definitely fun to use, however (and this is just a minor gripe on my half) SP in the beginning of the game is so scarce and that most of the time I am actually fighting SP-less. \n\nOverall, I am happy that this game is able to differentiate itself from other musou-type games, and it is definitely unique on its own. \n\nTo end off, Sophia is very adorable, and I think she's a great inclusion to the cast so far.

This is actually what a non Turn-role Persona game would be like. It is more of a Persona game than a Dynasty Warrior clone.\n\nThe game takes place after the event of Persona 5 during the summer vacation as the Phantom Thieves yet again find theirselves in another quest to change hearts.\n\nGameplay; Smooth 60fps locked. No drops. it is to be noted that some cutscenes are running at 30fps but there isnt many of them. The key bindings isn't that bad and it is easy to learn them and can be changed if you need to. The combat is very fast paced and the mechanics are well implemented. I'd give it a 9/10.\n\nGraphics: They are not bad but also not superb due to something that looks like a lack of strong AA but overall they are fine. 7.5/10\n\nSpecs needed: This game is not very demanding and even 700 series GTX cards can handle it fine as long as you tune the settings a bit. 8/10.\n\nMusic: Now this is the part that is actually an absolute hit. If you do buy the digital deluxe edition you have access to battle ost from previous persona games ranging from Persona revelation up to Persona 5 Strikers. The sound quality in Persona games is alway top notch and this one delivers as well. 9.5/10.\n\nFinal thoughts: Should you buy it? I would say wait for sales because, the standard version really doesn't shine like the digital deluxe edition with all its bonuses. However, for long time persona fans, I doubt this will be too much of a concern to them. I should also mention that , even if you did not play Persona 5 this is not an issue as this game seems to be a total different setting.

A solid game despite the lack of it's predecessor, P5 being on Steam (GIVE US P5R ON PC ATLUS / SEGA!) \n\nFull Review :\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes the traditional turn based combat gameplay of Persona and actually manages to make a pretty good hack'n'slash adaptation of it. Persona skills and all work well within a real-time environment, and you even have the ability to string them into combos for no SP cost too (SP is basically the \"mana\" of Persona, for the newcomers). \n\nThe game does have one major flaw though in it's execution, the lack of the social aspect of Persona. In the mainline Modern Persona games (Persona 3 FES / P3 Portable / Persona 4 Golden (it's on Steam too go buy it) / Persona 5 / P5R) you have a big focus on the social side of gameplay, interacting with your companions, potential romance options, etc., which tie into the dungeon crawling aspect of them by strengthening companions you have strong bonds too. None of that is present in Strikers here, which is a shame. \n\nStrikers is also much more linear than the mainline games. That's not to say the mainline games I'm comparing it too had multiple endings or anything (P4 had like 7, P5R had 4 or so if I remember right), but they had a TON of stuff mixed into the social side, such as choosing whether to go out with friends (strengthen bonds) or do something to strengthen your own stats on a specific day. Speaking of days, in Strikers there isn't any time progression outside of story events, so unlike in the main games, there's nothing really pressuring you to pick and choose things, so you can basically just sit and grind if you want, which, admittedly works well for Strikers gameplay wise, but still worth noting the difference there. \n\nThe game also lacks a lot of the Personas from 3-5 too, there's a lot, don't get me wrong, just MUCH more in the main games, though I'm not counting it as a negative thing, still plenty to choose from and you can easily use the Persona Points system (unique to Strikers, not in earlier games) and the accumulated power system to strengthen your favorite Personas. That plus the fusion system which is a Persona mainstay allow for you to easily take that level 5 weak Persona and turn him into a 99-Stat monster. \n\nThe dungeons are also different here as well, they're much more open than the ones in Persona 3, 4 and 5, while keeping the similar style that dungeons in Persona 5 had. This is mostly due to the combat being you and the Phantom Thieves against a horde of shadows every time, but it works. \n\nOverall it's pretty great. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal (or the base Persona 5) you may be somewhat lost with the terms and world of the game, but outside of the story of the Phantom Thieves and the Metaverse, you can still have a good time and know the basics. The story isn't as good as the mainline games either, likely due to it being shorter and more condensed (40 hours in Strikers vs. 100 hours in Persona 4 Golden or 150 in P5 Royal). \n\nAlso, if you're wondering about the DLC under the game, ignore the All Out Attack Pack, but definitely go and buy the legacy BGM pack, as it includes battle themes from every mainline Persona games, even the old 1990s Persona 1 and 2 that nobody remembers. It also includes the very popular themes from P3, P3P, P4, and P4G, that is to say\n\n- A Lone Prayer (Persona 1)\n-Mass Destruction (Persona 3)\n-Wiping All Out (Persona 3 Portable, from the Female Main Character's Route in that game)\n- Reach out To the Truth (Persona 4)\n- Time to Make History (Persona 4 Golden) \n\nYou actually also get the themes from Persona 5  and Persona 5 Royal IN THE BASE GAME WITHOUT DLC, you just have to beat the main story and get a game cleared save file to get access to them, but the base game does come with a pretty awesome rock remix of Last Surprise (P5's theme) in the base game before then, it's pretty neat. \n\nI'd like to end this review by engaging in the time honored tradition of port-begging\n*ahem*\n\nPLEASE ATLUS / SEGA GIVE US PERSONA 3 FES and PERSONA 5 ROYAL!\n\nThank you for reading this review and I hope it helped.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bb8eb0e4dfbe5f86bb41cba821f66f02", "author": "dd07e479ed5852caaced99382c12f474", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 761, "content": "10/10 if you played the last game youll love this, thats all you need to know \nand its a sequel to persona 5 not royal so dont get this if you havent played the original persona 5", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bb025c377beb5bf6a7aa72575cd9df08", "author": "c7187574961054c493006d06b5e180b6", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1260, "content": "Very fun!\n\nReally recommend this game to others.\nI do prefer palaces over jails but the combat is harder wich makes it more fun.\nHaven't experienced a bug yet wich is good i guess.\nNOTE: If you haven't seen/played persona 5 you should do before to get a better understanding of the game like character backstories and that.\nIf you dont have a ps4 and can't get the game.

I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.", "comments": 4, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b64abcdbabe75863ada7bb9fbb10fe0d", "author": "2231b89ee1065d4ca9951d3b977bdd61", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 955, "content": "Buckle up, this port's on shaky ground.

This game's twist is basically that it turns the traditional turn based Persona system into a stylish and dynamic real-time RPG with some hack-n-slash elements. Also this game is definitely quite easy until the ending where it gets somewhat challenging so I recommend to play on Hard which honestly feels kind of easy for someone new to the genre. Another gripe is that the game right now as a crashing issue and I see other people are experiencing it too - personally I have crashed like 7-8 times during my gameplay (usually when fast-travelling) so I HIGHLY recommend saving whenever you can until this issue is resolved. If you can look past these flaws, The story is solid, you'll get your values worth with ~40 hours of content, and the game is legitimately fun and addicting. \n\n8/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b28d2eb85a9857599375f003541f92ce", "author": "ffbf4bf032cf5b02b88bd3c51e9acac6", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1652, "content": "Needs more Yoshizawa", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b267e6b1412f59e98312ea3635c6686c", "author": "fb73290bce035291bc3ed85d869f254b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 298, "content": "A spin off to a popular game acting as a sequel and its actually amazing???

The bugs for now however need to be fixed. Still 1000 percent recommend, but the crashing and lag in cutscenes among numerous other glitches just take away from the experience for a bit. I have already for example lost 2 hours of play time due to crashing. \n\nYou should still buy it, its really fun and a unique twist. \nSave frequently and if your cutscenes are screwed like mine you can find them on YouTube to watch them to full potential\n\n\nEdit: After finishing game, its up there on my favourite games list. As much as the fandom groans and complains about milking the series the quality for the product is really here with Strikers. The new characters are great, I'm still not sure how I feel about Royal not being connected what so ever plus the weird ending of Royal. If we take that out of the picture I think this ending after connecting to base P5 is really good. Once again the OST is phenomenal as with pretty much every Persona game. Definitely some things I'm going to add to my playlist from this game. The combat also feels really good and is a unique change of pace that still keeps Persona mechanics. \n\nMy only gripes with this game are the bugs. I know Atlus is working on it however I did not get a single cutscene that wasn't a laggy mess. As I mentioned above I had to go on YouTube to see them to their full potential. That being said when they aren't a laggy mess the cutscenes and the characters/environments look great here.\n\nFrom here on forward I couldn't really say whether I'd rather P5's characters get more arc or not. One could obviously make the argument that its being milked harder then P4 even but I wouldn't complain with one last sendoff from the P5 cast. Whether it be a P5 arena or a completely new spinoff. Or we could immediately go to P6 which I wouldn't complain about either. \n\nI started with P5 as my first game and then played P4 here on Steam. Who knows what in store for the anniversary but I would love to see P3 get the Persona 4 Remaster treatment. Beyond that, if Atlus started bringing more releases to Steam I think that would be great. \n\nTime for me to wait to try out Nocturne as my first entry into SMT", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a45b962b0fd65e62a27bcfb8e00ce568", "author": "8fa89f244a9c5c8c97c4c898f082b6d0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 198, "content": "Seems like the bugs are fixed, so I am back to loving this game.\n\n10/10 would persona again.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a45abf57e6b85a1fb9f0dad6c812fb30", "author": "23513b9ac4565347933db807741572dd", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 714, "content": "Persona 5, 2 electric boogaloo", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a41bcaa1fac952f5bdb9ccacf5d4971a", "author": "4db32b1c2dc25b418bb2f68c403ef363", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2662, "content": "I don't know about you.. but I really do feel like a phantom thief playing this XD You'll love both the old and new characters here.

These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n", "comments": 13, "source": "steam", "helpful": 120, "funny": 9, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a32fd14b61ff51febdc06419750c811c", "author": "462bc7229aa65b7dbdeab95ce807363f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2199, "content": "GOOD GAME NGL\n\nATLUS WITH THEM W'S \nNOW PLEASE GIVE US Persona 3 FES Remake <3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a2b16134c82f545fbb5b1709fb5dfb0c", "author": "132531d628195975ad89db3be428b2e9", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 845, "content": "zenkichi best girl", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a211bb0e0ff2543dbe0cd0339838ddcc", "author": "422e368c4fda5954815035dcfb066834", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 834, "content": "[h1][b]A surprisingly great mash-up between [i]Musou game[/i] and [i]Persona[/i] game[/b][/h1]\n\nCombat works much more like your typical [i]Musou[/i] game, a real time hack'n slash, while also incorporates the tactical playstyle of Persona/SMT games (ie. exploiting foe's ailment weakness, 1-more/press-turn battle system, collecting personas/demons).

I love the whole \"roadtrip across japan\" thing they have going on.\n[spoiler] The structure of the villains isn't too bad either, I love the idea of showing a character that's pretty much every respective phantom thief if they had taken a different route in life. [/spoiler]\nAlso Haru is the best girl in all of existence so any more interactions with her is always a plus in my book.\n\nThe only 2 cons I can see are kind of nit-picky.\n1: It doesn't include any mention of the additional story of p5 royal, but I can understand that since the japanese version of this game released before royal was added. That doesn't stop me from wanting to see more of Kasumi and Maruki, though.\n2: There's a few quality of life features taken away compared to base persona 5, like not being able to \"jog\" in the overworld. I can understand that since it was developed in part by a different studio, though.\n\nEasily the best thing in this game is that it doesn't feel like it's 90% cutscenes and it doesn't super hold your hand in the beginning like p5 did. Heck, you can skip cutscenes entirely if you want, rather than having to fast forward through them.\n\n[b] Overall: Phenomenal game. I can easily see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game trying to 100% it, like I have with every other Persona game, from 1 to 5. \nIf you enjoy games like dynasty warriors or hyrule warriors, and you like the story of persona 5, I can not recommend this game enough.[/b]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a02860b422465d0caa3f100429d51bff", "author": "8526908a8b835c6a933302fed4135d87", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2068, "content": "Fantastic Persona game with a unique twist, Would recommend for all Persona fans.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9f078afae523510baf488c49c08fbea9", "author": "2c49c39af9225367ab7db545c4b3d1cb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 319, "content": "Morgana didn't yeet me to sleep. 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9e0348af6bde5c5ca60a46e0b3fccdca", "author": "e7473093c03d5b31b6209734af339002", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 720, "content": "I would literally consume anything Persona Related.

I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\n\nOn a serious note, this game brings a trimmed down, but still immensely enjoyable version of Persona 5's overworld, with a twist for the combat. It translates surprising well to an action based hack and slash. There will be an adjustment period for anyone who's previously played a persona game because several of the button assignments are different to compensate for the new combat (like the persona summoning menu is now a special attack button).  The platforming is also no longer on rails for the most part, so movement is a bit more choppy than it was in persona 5.\n\nHowever, after an hour or two of getting used to fighting, its a surprisingly rewarding experience. It emphasizes reflexes and situational awareness to dodge attacks and use combos to fire off skills seamlessly. As well as rewarding persona building, because having the right set of skills to hit weaknesses or apply crowd control can be the a major factor in how smoothly a fight will go.\n\nHard mode even provides a pleasant challenge, forcing you to pay attention in most encounters, or else you most likely be overwhelmed by enemy abilities and attacks. Forcing you to really dive into the combat system, and learn to string together combos and dodging efficiently.\n\nI was expecting something good as a spin off, but it went beyond my expectations into a great game to play on its own.

Fundamentally, modern Persona is defined by its balance between the RPG dungeon crawling and the life sim, tying them together with a calendar. This game removes the time constraints, making the calendar mere decoration. Moreover, social links/confidants are replaced with the Bond system, giving players access to a variety of perks of their choosing. The fusion system itself has also been greatly simplified. With all of this in mind, it seems as though this game throws out everything that made its predecessors special. However, this game gains more focus on narrative as a result of this. Many fun character interactions stem from this focus and smaller cast. It allows the game to take a form all its own, rather than being more of the same. And all the more, the battles still feel very Persona-esque thanks to ailments, follow-ups, baton passes, weakness, technicals, All-Out Attacks, Persona-switching, and more. I can't recommend this if you don't like action games. But if you even have a minor interest and you played the original/Royal Persona 5, then I heavily recommend this game.

I'd say this is an almost perfect adaptation from the turn-based style to a hack-and-slash type of game, keeping the same Shadows weaknesses, strengths and spells.\n\nHowever, it has its flaws. By the time I'm writing this review the game kept crashing randomly, either while loading a new in-game rendered cutscene (which can make you lose quite a bit of progress in the first dungeons) or when entering a Jail. The Anti-Aliasing messes with the text a bit (not something that makes the game unplayable, but it feels a bit weird). \n\nThe Keyboard and Mouse Button Configuration is also severely lacking. It's not as bad as only having preset controls like Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but anything to the right of \"Enter\" is unbindable, which means anyone who uses the Arrow Keys will have a really hard time playing unless they have a controller.\n\nBut still, the game is awesome and well worth of being a sequel to Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8e2a1cbcc70d551f86fb4cebecd4931a", "author": "e56bacb23209595abfd6016c1dcdddd0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 417, "content": "The return of the Phantom Thieves couldn't have been better than this.\n\nIf you loved Persona 5 or the Royal version just buy it.

And that a good thing. \nThe combat is fun and is solid musou action.\n\nthe world feels like a blend between musou and persona, open maps with parts to jump on or a city to explore and investigate. You wont get bored of the character interactions and when you enter the jail you can go where you want. Sneak up to a enemy and start the combat in a closed up environment that fixes the open musou combat from other Koei titles.

It doesn't play very smooth at all and I spent a pretty significant amount of time in the key-bindings menu trying to get things squared away. The issue was that there are so many commands, but the keyboard & mouse setup is designed as if you're just playing with keyboard, so the same buttons used to for left and right mouse are in the immediate area of WASD. This would be fine, if it didn't \"push\" other important commands to further locations from my hand on the keyboard, causing me to have to adjust my hand placement on the keyboard pretty regularly during fights until I changed the settings.\n\nThis isn't something that makes me regret getting the game, and I absolutely LOVE it now that I've adjusted things. Super fun and entertaining successor to the original game. \n\n*Minor Spoiler*\n\nJust wanted knew players to be aware of this concern I had because the beginning of the game is heavy on combat tutorials. So even though it was guiding me how to play, it doesn't change the ease by which you can actually play. This detracted from my ability to fully dive into the introductory plot.

While I'm very excited to see more persona titles on steam, such as 4 golden, and 5 strikers, I really hope we see more of the main games ported. Persona 3, Persona 5, ect. If you've played and enjoyed persona 5, you'll probably like strikers. The same characters are back for a \"Vacation\" story focused around old friends getting back together.  The gameplay is solid, the anime cutscenes are high quality, and the graphics are very pretty! This game is great on the couch with a controller, or with a keyboard and mouse, although I prefer this as a couch title personally. If you haven't played persona 5 yet, you might not enjoy this game as much. I'm sure it would feel similar to joining a well established friend group, and realizing you kinda get most of the insight jokes, but that you also have a sense of loss that you weren't there when they were created. Regardless, story isn't the only attraction here, and the gameplay is solid enough that I can still recommend strikers to someone who hasn't played persona 5. That being said, Atlus, please give us persona 3 and persona 5 on steam. The whole \"Steam vs other platforms such as epic\" argument might sound shallow on paper, but steam is offering so many wonderful features that no other storefront can. A big example of this is Proton support, which allows windows games to run on linux. Valve is hardware and software agnostic, allowing many gamers to come together and enjoy their favorite titles in the way they'd like. I'm happy to support Atlus on my platform of choice, as it is a platform that supports my freedom of choice. Here's to more wonderful persona games coming to steam in the future.

Spin-offs are bad, at least as a general rule. And then, along came Persona 5 Strikers, which serves as much of a spin-off as a sequel. It is by no means a perfect game, no game is perfect, but this is goddam near it. Atlus could have re-skinned a warriors game whit Persona, and i would have bought it. Instead, what i got was a love letter to both, the Phantom Thieves and the Players. \n\nThis carries over a great deal of Persona 5. While some elements are shaved due to mechanics, most of them evolved with the gameplay change. Confidants are replaced by a bond system, you generate bond points trough certain requests or by fighting along characters. As expected the buffs from bonds are geared towards action games, more damage, faster bond growth, etc. At the same time this serves as a much friendlier system to the player, while still advances the narrative and deepens the bond between characters with the random personal request.\nAll the over the top action and showtimes are still present, and i must say, they are one of my favorite animations from the game, Atlus really brought out the personality of each Phantom Thieve trough this silly little animations. The combat itself feels fluid and gratifying, if at times a bit repetitive killing random trash. But where the game really shines is trough their boss fights. This has one of my favorite Boss encounters of the saga, and i thought it was nearly impossible to beat Futaba's Palace Boss. It could still use a bit more information on screen, like the direction and the type of incoming attacks from outside the screen, but it is by no means a deal breaker.\n\nThe downside to this game is, if you have not played Persona 5 OG you will probably feel left out on most of the conversations. A lot of references and inside jokes are beautiful winks to veterans of the saga, but might flew over the head of those not familiar with the lore, and i must say, this might lower your enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall i will say, give this game a change if you are a fan of Persona 5, if you haven't played Persona 5 yet, i will still recommend buying this one, as it is a very good warriors like game, and despite the random reference you might miss, the game does a very good job at exploring the characters and the narrative is A+ as i have come to expect from Atlus.\n\nPros\n\n++Combat is fluid and rewarding\n++Graphics are BEAUTIFUL\n++4k 60fps\n++Controls are very good and have a variety of schemes\n++More P5 and Phantom Thieves\n++Story Rich as any other Persona/Shin Megami\n\nCons\n\n--Heavy loaded with references and inside jokes (not necessary to enjoy the game, but you do miss some of the enjoyment)\n--No TIa Takemi ( SRSLY NGGS where is ma TIA)\n--Somewhat short (about 40-50ish hours depending on how fast you rush it)\n--No costumes DLC (yes for this game, that is a Con, trust me on this one)\n\nAll in all, if you are a P5 fan this is a 9/10, if you are not, this is easy an 8/10.

You should play and beat either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this in order to not spoil yourself on characters and events, the game assumes you have beaten that game. \n\nTo sum it up briefly, Strikers takes all the trappings from P5 and mixes in a battle system that feels like an Action-RPG in a musou's trench coat, in which you need to pay attention to weaknesses and strengths of both your team and your enemy. The game runs incredibly smooth as well, though it seems to have a 60 fps cap if that matters at all to anyone. The plot even follows a similar progression to the main game, so it can also be host to bout of nostalgia if it's been a while since you originally danced with the Phantom Thieves.  Most of the time management mechanics have been removed and you don't need to worry about hustling or figuring out who is the best to spend your time with. There are still moments where you can miss limited time items or side requests if you push on ahead without completing them. You can exit and enter dungeons without penalty and are otherwise encouraged to do so to replenish your HP and SP. Combos feel really good and even incorporate Persona skills, so you always have an avenue to attack enemy weaknesses. All the new characters are also great additions as well, and mesh well with the returning cast. \n\n30 hours in, I can still say that it should provide any P5 fans both a new and familiar experience, and it stands as probably one of my favorite Musou games, based on both the quality of the writing and the fantastic combat.  \n", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "79bdedf154335e889dcef7598cd19d14", "author": "e34bfd84693850b783ce02ce57f86b77", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 100, "content": "Aliiice Make me your PogChamp", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7997c33342a751eb991519aae3ffbb2d", "author": "5b388d988ef05811b509dcb5ea87d65f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 749, "content": "The plot of the game's opening concerns Belle Delphines shadow giving people the Simp Plague. 10/10 (I am not joking)\nGameplay feels like Persona 5 with real time combat.

Even the combat itself doesn't feel out of place and seamlessly flows in and out whenever fights start.\n\nThis game has all the elements of persona 5 woven into it in an interesting way, things like baton passes, follow up attacks, persona fusing and all out attacks are still here but made to fit the hack and slash gameplay of a warriors game.\nThe difficulty is actually decent for one of these type games too, usually you just mindlessly mash buttons and feel good taking out thousands at a time but here there are fewer enemies on screen and a harder fight overall, the bosses themselves are also unique and are much more challenging than anything found in its similar titles.\n\nThe music to this game shattered my expectations, I assumed it would be good already seeing as both of the franchises have amazing music already but they really outdid themselves. I got the legacy music pack expecting to flick to that but so far i haven't even wanted to incase i missed out on any of the incredible new tracks.\n\nThe DLC for this game in terms of items is definitely skippable, it honestly doesn't do much at all and so far I haven't used any of it myself. The persona level up points may come in handy eventually but the skills haven't really been necessary, they already give you tons and if you have played a persona game before then you already know how to fuse your way to victory.\n\nThe story takes place after regular Persona 5 and not Royal. As such some players of the newer version may notice differences in character portraits or persona passives in fusing. The new character from royal also doesn't make an appearance but there are plenty more new faces added regardless\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that the game looks similar to the ps3 version of P5 and the text is a little off putting at first. I eventually got used to it but I wish there were options to make it look a bit smoother. Other than that it runs fine during gameplay with the occasional crash which can be annoying though it throws so many opportunities to save at you that the most progress I lost was 1 cutscene that i skipped upon reloading anyway.\n\nOverall I'd say this is the most amount of effort of any Koei-Tecmo mainline or spin-off game and even people who don't like their usual stuff should give this one a shot. If you are a fan of persona 5 then you really don't want to miss out on this.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f78304940115824a2d5458adea1c0ef", "author": "f73b19bd0ead565d8dd457c3c14c9745", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 659, "content": "N I C E.\n\nBring P3FES and P5R to steam and I swear I will buy them again.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f39d01cba8151cd85d196c863acc7f0", "author": "1cc3f1f031ce509cba5ea73bc3f980fd", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2461, "content": "I finished the game before its official release.\n\nI have no life 10/10.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6edb7cfb33cd548d8b527e02c14197a5", "author": "011fa97d0907575784b4d97d0f7cd695", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1429, "content": "Not only a hella sweet persona 5 sequel but also on PC?\nHella heck yeah!

Also, I should not that you won't have as much social interactions as in previous entry, which might disappoint some people.\n\nThe plot feels strong (tho I find it a little bit repetitive), new characters are unique as it usually happens in Persona games.\n\nAnyway, if you are a Persona 5 and/or hack-slash games fan, you should get this game. It would be VERY preferable to play Persona 5 Royal or Persona 5 before playing this to better understand the plot and how the game world works, but it's not on PC (yet?). \n\nP.S.

Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.\n\n[h1]Some After Thought[/h1]\nWhat I said above is all true, this game is still a fantastic game and I urge anyone who interested in this game to play. HOWEVER, this game-by all means-still is not a traditional Persona experience. I still recommend mainline Persona more than this game overall. And since this is a beat 'em up game and this is a linear-story game, the replay-ability is next to none apart from the completionist gamer. So for me, the flaws of this game is really \"It's not normal Persona\" which is dumb. ATLUS did a thing that throw us off, and they done a fantastic job.

The writing is on par with the original and Royal, and while this game is more of a \"fan service-y\" type deal, Atlus made sure to not forget about what made Persona 5 great in the first place, creating a fun road trip adventure that didn't need to be told, but I'm glad it was. Seeing the thieves older and wiser while also keeping their charm and traits from the original mad me smile, and allowed me to truly see just how much these characters have grown. \n\nThe Musou style combat mixed in with Persona turn based elements came together perfectly, and while the camera can be a but weird sometimes, the combat always remained fluid and fun and never got boring even until the very end of the game. Persona fusion also makes a return, and while I have my quarrels with the new PP system, Persona Fusion is still crazy fun to do, allowing the player to create some incredibly OP Persona's that just shred enemies to a fine shadow-y paste. \n\nI became a huge Persona fan after playing Royal back in August. I never really was a JRPG guy, but for some reason Persona 5 always peaked my interest, and when I finally played it I fell in love. The Phantom Thieves are probably my favorite cast of video game characters period, and after 6 months of playing through the entire franchise, I was incredibly happy to be with the thieves on another adventure. I just hope this isn't their last.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "62006683a09d53e49beba75db7b1da4d", "author": "645e33b102f65338951fb471f0df2d50", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 759, "content": "Makoto is still best girl.\nHaru finally has screentime making her a close second.\n\nYusuke is the storm that is approaching.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "61acb72381bd583e9f05bb65e8d7a098", "author": "08d6ead0b78650fc9ab13b959d9f4355", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 73, "content": "Love it !!!\n\n\n\nEdit : okay after playing over 20hr, i think this game too repetitive, that's not really my taste, so i need to change my mind", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "61a6060d0f24555584650fa505d6bd77", "author": "0e312b0a3d705bfeb3b4e6412e782fb0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1589, "content": "It's Persona 5 - 2.

The game and the plot is top notch but wait for a patch.

However, I start to run into random crashes in my after-run.

Although the fix on the forum says that to roll back the driver to 460.79, I was on that version of the driver, so I tried my luck updating the driver and it surprisingly fixed the problem. It was hell of a journey, and I don't think this game is worth recommending to others unless there is a patch coming out addressing all the crashes and porting problems.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated March 3rd\nI cannot proceed to play the game. I got stuck after the boss fight in 5th jail. Infinite loading black screen. Funny thing is every time I close the game I can here a bit audio as if the game has not crashed. This is a problem faced by many other players and I have tried all kinds of fixed but none really worked.\n[spoiler]I have fight my copy for more than 10 times now and I am literally speed running the boss fight. I am tired.[/spoiler]\n\nI have point out many other bugs brought by the port but none really affected my experience this much.

Although the quality of the animation isn't the highest, it covers all the important stories and can get enough background information to not get lost playing this game.\n\nAs for the game itself, so far so good. Need to play more to see if this game can match or even beat P5.\n\n\u81ea\u5e26\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4f4e\u4ef7\u533a\u6bd4\u6e2f\u670d\u6253\u6298\u8fd8\u8981\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u597d\u8bc4\uff01\n\n[Updated after 10 hrs playtime]\nAfter finishing the first part of the story, I have a general grasp on how the game is played and can say more on the performance and gameplay itself.\nThere are some flaws to the game, including relatively longer load time comparing to other games and to playing it on PS5 (I am running this game also on a high-performance SSD). Especially when I load up the game, it usually takes me 10 to 15 seconds to actually be able to play the game. I am not sure the problem can be fixed, and it is rather minor problem, but this will be frustrating after more hours of playtime, which I know I will be having. Another thing that stands out to me is that although I am playing this game on a controller, the character can only move along the 8 axis using the left stick. This is definitely bad porting, and I haven't experienced anything like this on other ported games like Yakuza series or Atlus' own Persona 4 Golden.\n\nGameplay is solid so far, but also missing out on a lot of thing that really made persona series stands out from other JRPG games - daily interactions. While the game still using the calendar system like its predecessors, there are less layer to that because you are free to spend however long time you want in one day and do whatever you want. Being able to go and return palace (jails) freely without worrying about time passing is more player-friendly, but it feels like cheating to just freely go in and out to recover your hp and sp.\nUp till this point of the game, I haven't had any side stories and bonding time with other characters. The city has much less things to explore and places to go. Although it seems like we got to visit more cities, so that might still be fun.\nI guess I just miss the time to spend with all my [spoiler]waifus[/spoiler]friends and school life.\nThe fighting is fun, and the way the incorporate the old persona system to this musou type game is very interesting.\n\nA solid 8/10 so far. Definitely recommend if you have played Persona 5 before, and worth to play if you haven't and don't mind missing out on some stories or spend time watching the anime series", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4f25683467d552d9bd1213405435fb00", "author": "590196590b095dbb8909f1a13484fd25", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1762, "content": "I'm actually very, very surprised. So, a little thing about me, Persona 5 is my favorite game, of all the one's ive played, and i've played it through several times and royal the same. So when i hear about a spin off of my favorite game, i'm not only skeptical, but i feel like i had a higher expectation for this game than other games. This is a very promising game, as of current i'm only on the second (To not spoil) \"Part\". It's not just a Dynasty warrior style game with a shiny persona coat of paint on it, as it presents more of a different style and challenge than the normal copy pasted format.\n\nThe story is on par with any other persona style story: Very engaging, very in depth, and full of small fun ventures of the phantom thieves in their everyday lives as teenagers. The thing that surprised me was the game play itself. It's not just a copy or direct version of a \"Warriors\" style of game, but offers more of a twist on the combat. With the resistances of not just the larger personas, or the \"Generals\" in the other warrior games, but even all of the small fry shadows that liter the battlefield. You have to be mindful of all the resistances, all the weaknesses, and all of your parties SP and HP gauges, allowing there to be a higher skill ceiling for you to pull off some sweet ass combos. \n\nI also really enjoy that the game is difficult, it's not just \"Smash square to kill all the enemies\" like other warriors games, but it really makes you wary of all the enemies at the same time, and makes you use some brainpower to play. There are only three difficulties (Maybe more later or once i finish the game) But the game is definitely more of a challenge than i was expecting.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game. Maybe i'll update this review later once i beat the game, but for having a 14 hour save and only on the second part, i'm looking forward to how much content there is in the game, and how much more fun i will have with this game. If you like Warriors style games, this is an easy grab, just expect it to be harder than usual. If you're a persona fan, it's got all your favorite characters, plus some new ones (Especially one super adorable character), and it currently has the persona style story.

There's a bit of a learning curve, I died a fair amount on the first few bosses, but once you get a feel for the flow of combat, you can string together some nasty combos. This made the second major boss feel like a cakewalk in comparison, not because it was easier in difficulty, but because I knew how to use my SP and movement more effectively. I'm near the end of the third \"dungeon\" and this pattern has continued. XP and money grinding is always available, and when the game says leaving the dungeon has no downside, it means there's literally no downside.

The game runs great now. It's run great since they patched it back in June 2021. Now that performance isn't an issue, I've gotta say that this game is incredibly fun. You might say that it's just a coat of Persona 5 on an otherwise vanilla Musou game and I'd say that's pretty fair, but it's a pretty thick coat of Persona 5 and that really changes the flavor dramatically. This is the kinda collab Musou game that can get non-Warriors fans into the genre. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed Persona 5. I don't know if I'd recommend it to someone who's not played the original, though. It leans on your knowledge of the characters pretty heavily, even if it doesn't really need you to know the original story.\n\n\n\nOld review: This might one day be a fantastic game, but right now I've gotta say hold off on buying it until they fix all the bugs. I and numerous other people have had some fairly frequent and obnoxious bugs. I've had to fight 2 bosses multiple times because the following cutscenes cause me to crash to desktop. I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible. When they patch this game to an acceptable level, I'll completely rewrite this review.", "comments": 15, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "40caf5cdbc1c5e98b90fa0ff774dd931", "author": "dce3df1a92455d05913fb16fb36d7b0a", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 90, "content": "never saw it coming", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "407668b979b95ced8e93bc25cc3ee633", "author": "c3b08390160452c48d415e11ae7b628b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1350, "content": "I'm not a fan of this warrior type games but if you love Persona you are going to enjoy a lot this sequel.

Sure, there's a degree of predictability, but for the most part, it's a fun and unpredictable ride. \n\nWhat I've played of this combined with my experience with Astral Chain leads me to believe that, if Omega Force let themselves out of their own cage more often, they would easily outpace Platinum at their own strengths. Each game of theirs I've played since Dynasty Warriors 8 has begun to diverge further and further from the formula they used to strictly employ and it is completely for the better. Hyrule Warriors: Calamity was pretty good, but...I don't know if Atlus really knew how to draw their potential out of them or if they just were encouraged to just let loose and go wild but holy crap the gameplay feels great.\n\nCouple that with the soundtrack, which the mediocre tracks in this outpace some of the best tracks in the already stellar soundtrack Persona 5 had and you have a mixture for a game that frequently just hits the damn zenith for what an action game can make the player feel.\n\nAll that said, the game doesn't forget the series it's in. Many have said it's a love letter to fans of the series and it feels exactly like that. The plot builds on the characters they spent over 100 hours feeding us backstory and introducing to us, and Strikers serves to just show us how all of them have grown, both individually and as a group of friends who haven't seen each other for a year, but still kept in touch.\n\nI could honestly go on longer but I think the point is made, and I'd rather not spoil anything.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "34d02374cf045384a23245422fdc1a6a", "author": "02312a591740590e8d703e3ffe378154", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 91, "content": "Got a feeling all this \"long loading times\" and other bullshit whining is actually a snoy psyop.\nNo idea what kind of a mashed potato battery they're playing this game on, but on my piece of trash which can be considered a necrophilia fetish, it plays like a charm.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "33dfa44ebff653f594d46dc95227c550", "author": "668cf541b6b85f62b36c2d4211dfe086", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 48, "content": "Persona 5 sequel , takes place after P5 plot.. hack&slash game and the non-combat portions play like persona 5's non-combat walking and talking stuff.. definitely going to be worth playing if you liked P5 and just want more.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3398b8461b6e5cb7832b3e09100ce123", "author": "866cae3483705eb5b2b70cbe86102ce0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 116, "content": "The turn based combat in persona is already fun (even when they're normally notoriously unfun), they decided to turn it into normal combat and I love it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "331ad6a4f35059b58bc39a0e4b09d1ad", "author": "27b4c1e037bf5278bc7cf16abd888f04", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2687, "content": "Thought it was a cash grab like the dancing games but i really ended up liking it, if you're a persona fan then this is an easy buy, lets support the PC port so hopefully one day we get Persona 5 Royal on steam too.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "331895bd936c5e26a5930930f9ecd644", "author": "c4f2dfd1629751e395781ec3eaad32bd", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 25, "content": "Left Ctrl to shoot is perfectly normal.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "32681e9e557e586bbb3d8c92e9077cd6", "author": "4c491eb40af9578d977439d857a4038d", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 488, "content": "Makoto Niijima is the queen. \n\nYou also can be a cat-bus-thingy.\n\nPlay with controller.\n\n5/7 - perfect score.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "313f042162b15daea4efbea2566721a3", "author": "7192218251ff560caab2233b522066ea", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 196, "content": "8/10, with an emphasis on the Persona more than the Strikers.\n\nOverall I'd definitely give this game a recommendation, but moreso if you're a fan of the Persona games and if you played the original.

It doesn't quite have that 'one versus a thousand' feeling of being a badass, combat is a bit more small-scale and implements a lot of Persona gameplay for better or worse. \n\nThe story's been great so far, the new characters are really interesting, and goddamn does the P5 aesthetic continue to kick ass.\n\nLike I said, an overall recommendation from me, but I'm not exactly sure who this gameplay's intended for, while it's not *bad* it doesn't really appeal to me as a Persona fan, nor as a Warriors fan.

I enjoyed P5R, but I felt it leaned a little too heavily into fan service, and as a result wasn't as good as just regular Persona 5 (that and I'm still mad about how broken Okumura was in that game, but that's a different story.) This game though - I might actually like it more than Persona 5. The combat is fast paced and intense, where you're swapping between characters rapidly for follow up attacks, hitting weaknesses, and using environmental objects to beat down shadows. I never thought I'd get to play as a cat wearing a bandit mask on a skateboard running over Jack Frost, but here we are.\n\nThe social aspect of this game is definitely [i]different[/i] than in Persona 5, though I wouldn't say it's worse. It's a lot more based on exploring cities for cool moments with your team and building the team skills you want out of the social points you earn for spending time with them. The time system is also very different than in P5. Though the calendar still progresses, it moves with set story points rather than each time you leave a palace or spend time with a friend. Again, this isn't [i]worse[/i] than P5, it's just different. Strikers is trying to put a pretty decently sized game into one summer vacation, so they only have what, six weeks to tell their story? I think it took me more than six weeks to get my first confidants to max rank in P5, so I have to admit that this system works a lot better for this setup.\n\nThe real highlight for me so far though is honestly the characters. Persona 5 had some great villains, but most of them were irredeemably awful people, end of story. This game though is willing to tread into grey area a lot more willingly. You're going to face off against objectively bad people - but you'll also see why they became this way, how they're real people tumbling down slippery slopes of mistakes and bad decisions.  Without getting too much into spoiler territory, the two bosses I've gone against so far have had a lot more dimension than the earlier bosses of P5. This entire tangent is also ignoring the new NPCs who are on your side. I've found these characters to be quirky, interesting, and willing to add some life and spirit to an already vibrant group. Even the Phantom Thieves' dynamic feels a little more polished than in P5; The team, while still up to their usual antics, are calling out great kills by specific members, appreciating even Ryuii's accomplishments. I know, people not making fun of Ryujii. Who'd have thought we'd see the day?\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is a mix of funky new jams and the original P5 soundtrack on steroids. What's not to love?\n\nTL;DR: A sequel has a lot to live up to, especially if it's changing genres, and this absolutely exceeded my expectations.

Brings me right back to April of 2017. I've been playing this on the Digital Deluxe Pre-release, and while there are a few issues with loading screens, they'll likely be fixed with the day one patch.\n\nGameplay wise, this FEELS like Persona, but as an action game. There's some Dynasty Warriors/Musou influence, yes, but it doesn't have the same map control/base defense loop that Musou often has in its spinoffs (e.g. Hyrule Warriors) and instead opts to give much more of the stage to Persona 5. For returning fans, Fusion is back, but it's less about picking which Personas you want to fuse, and is a bit more linear. The most important part is getting different Personas, since EACH ONE will CHANGE Joker's moveset in few ways, and the Persona he has equipped can freely cast some preset skills (tied to each individual Persona) by using his Persona combo finishers. You can still fuse some pretty impressive Personas if you want to, with Reflect/Absorbs and the like, but it's not as important.\n\n\nThe other characters all feel really, really good; even in comparison to Joker, and they EACH have their own unique attribute to set them apart! Basically, Ryuji's ability is charged attacks, Makoto's is motorcycle, Haru can hold her strong attacks out, etc.. Building your party around which playstyles you like right from the get go is nice too.\n\nStory wise and in play, it feels like Persona 5-2. Some scenes have already gotten to me emotionally, and if you wanted less black-and-white themes in Persona 5 and more gray, you should be pleased with the Jail Monarchs in this game. Jumping right back in with the old cast feels natural, and while you can tell the writers had fun referencing the community, everyone feels like they're still them.\nI also like the implication that everyone isn't starting from ground zero as Phantom Thieves; they're rusty, but they're still more than capable of taking out hordes of shadows by themselves.\n\nI don't like out of 10 ratings, so I'll say this is a damn fun game and I recommend it to anyone who likes Persona 5. If you haven't played 5, I do REALLY recommend playing that first, but this game honestly doesn't do a terrible job reviewing what is what for first timers.\nEven if you don't like Musou, you might be pleasantly surprised.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2c6607e55bc057b89b3c3d2f557d3580", "author": "e662bcd0a1345c09ae8dc7305f1414d8", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1019, "content": "its another persona game, need i say more? \nbut in all seriousness, give this game a chance. although play either persona 5 or persona 5 royal before this", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2c1963e4432859679385a6e360d89830", "author": "23911854b4f356f4b5942ef2e12af005", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 262, "content": "Great so far.

The story is definitely getting more interesting at this point.\n\nUpdate (13 hours in): The story is picking up now and the enemies are getting tougher. It's ramping up like a typical Persona game.\n\nReview in progress: \n\nAs a Persona fan, I can tell you this truly FEELS like a Persona game. \n\nThat means you get the best and worst of Persona in every form. I'm about 7 hours into Strikers, and the pacing is incredibly slow, just like Persona 5. This game mirrors Persona in the sense that it really doesn't respect your time, but it also mirrors it in having an interesting story, fun new characters that expand the Persona lore, and all of the usual hijinks you expect from the series. \n\nThe gameplay here is very novel and repetitive. They've adapted pretty much all Persona mechanics to a third person action game format, and that's rad. You get to play with the whole cast and level up their abilities. If you find the style of game fun, you'll have a great time. If you get easily bored of beating up large groups of mostly weak enemies, you'll probably get bored of Strikers. \n\nSo far, I feel like I can recommend this to Persona fans. There are some crashing and black screen issues, but you can work around them. \n\nP.S. it's still really cringy how sexualized some of the characters are, just like in every Persona game.

In general, I think this is a good game and enjoyed most of my time with it. However, there is definitely parts I did not like.\n\nStory:\n For the most part, I thought the story was fun. There were times where it got dull or just felt extremely rushed that I didn't like, but I overall liked the story. There is a decent amount of parts that do feel like reuses of things that happened in the series before, mainly Persona 5. Those didn't really bother me too much except for at a certain point in the story that I just found to be extremely lazy writing. I also found two of the villains to either be too \"evil\" or not a bad person for the most part.\n\nGameplay:\n Personally I love the gameplay. I find it really fun and a unique twist on the gameplay style for the type of game this is. If you are not a fan of the beat em up style of Warriors games, then you'll probably not like the gameplay as much. However, there is enough differences in my opinion that would make it worth a shot atleast. It also has the dungeon crawling of a normal Persona game, just not exactly the same. There is more expansive spaces than a typical Persona game.\n\nCharacters:\n For the most part I really liked the returning cast and the new cast added to this game. There were some points I found the returning cast used the same jokes too much, but other than that I liked them about as much as in P5/P5R. I honestly loved the new main cast characters. I found their character arcs, story and personality amazing. They were just overall really good characters. There were some not as major characters that I really liked as well. Overall, I just really liked the characters of this game.\n\nSound:\n I absolutely loved the soundtrack of this game. All the returning songs were great and all the new songs were amazing. There are even remixes of some returning songs and those remixes are so so good. The rest of the sounds were overall pretty good. There were only a few times where I didn't think sounds fit what was going on. As an example, there were some moves that just didn't fit the noise they made and threw me off.\n\n \n In the end, I still feel this is a really good game and a pretty good sequel to Persona 5. I also think it could fit for P5R a bit more than I originally thought when I got it. However, I'd only really recommend getting it if you're a fan of Persona, specifically Persona 5, and if you like the gameplay style. There is also a decent amount of bugs that have been reported and a few I have had, but they are working on them.

You know? THE TEAM! Joker, Panther, Haru, Morgana, Fox, Queen, Jail Bait who is still unplayable, and the newly added Jail Bait v.2 The game is flashy and STYLISH in the typical persona fasion except brought to us in the form of a musou game. So you can hack slash bomb and punch your way to the new world without having to press X to guard the next attack. It mixes up the typical musou formula by adding elements that were present in p5 and takes on a truly unique spin to what a musou fan would be used to. What more could a fan want? This is the team we know, This is the team we love.\n\nWell...\n\nI cannot recommend this game to either a persona fan or a musou fan, If you are coming from a game like DW or WO where you get 50+ unique characters with different personalities, unique skills, unique weapons, and unique abilities to attach to those weapons you are going to be left wanting because here all you get is about 6 characters with unique personalities, Personas (skills) and Weapons. They have shrunk the formula here and made things much simpler in order to appease the original fan base (presumably, there is no document stating that) which failed in my opinion. Reason it failed is because the original fan base is still left wanting as well. There was so much potential to introduce new phantom thieves with this \"sequel\" The Doctor, The GunShop owner, The Teacher, Lavenza (who is actually 2 people)  all of them could have been included or added later and present a unique set of weapons and game play elements. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive which is typical for a musou, HOWEVER, usually you get bored try a new character from a roster of 50+ people and here you get to get bored and try a new character about 6 times, if you get bored beyond that you are SOL so you better REALLY enjoy a particular move set. \n\nHonestly...\n\nI could go on but that's about the gist of it.

For context, long time fan, my first game was Persona 3 for the PS2, didn't finish, came back and finished P3FES around 2011, then bought a vita for P4G a little later, and fell in love with the franchise. I routinely get people into persona so you can imagine my surprise seeing P4G, then this game on steam! That being said, I decided to wait out persona 5 royal for a PC release, but I have played the original P5, so I had to grab this.\n\nWhat a great game! I think this is the best Persona spin off yet, having played the dancing games, fighting games, and persona Q. My last game of theirs was the -- rather disappointing-- Persona Q2. This game, though, Ignore the price tag, it's deserving off the full price, even being a spin off, it feels more like a sequel, with eight dungeons, and a ton to do. The combat is less dynasty warriors than I was expecting, and leans more toward a standard ARPG moveset. Playing on normal, you actually had to pay attention to weaknesses, and definitely couldn't just button mash through the game.\n\nPersona spinoff tropes like the throwaway characters are present here, but I actually liked the characters they added, which I almost never do, except the ones from Persona Q. The areas felt new and interesting, I loved the layout, and things felt much more expansive than Persona 5's Palaces, and that's saying a TON because those were already pretty fleshed out. One is a police officer in a troubled relationship with his daughter and the other is a robot questioning how to be human, which are character designs that are molded from persona 4 and 3 respectively. I was disappointed at first, but they really turned the characters into their own, and they sort of molded into their own, I left the game enjoying their characters a lot more than I did coming in, especially the police officer.\n\nI'm not too fond of the cast of Persona 5 and I still found myself pretty invested in the story. Right when the Palace format started to get boring, they switched things up and had an unexpected ending. That being said, there are a few spoilers for Persona 5, however I believe this game doesn't exist in the continuity of Persona 5 : Royal, so if you're worried about spoilers for that game, you're good. That being said, you have to wonder why we don't have Persona 5, or Royal on steam yet. I know for sure that there are people waiting to play this, since it's basically a sequel to the original. The character and bonus content that was revealed in Royal doesn't seem to affect the cast of this game's continuity, very strange considering the events of P3FES are considered canon, same for P4G.\n\n\nGreat port, I had a few crashes but they were following about 7 hours of consecutive play (oops). Other than that, great optimization, Persona 5's graphics look so much better at 4K 60fps! Great job as always Atlus, i'd love to see Royal on here, as well as Persona Q and some of the other spin off games! If you're on the fence, grab it to support Atlus' PC presence! They were already pretty Anti-PC for years, and i'm thinking the sales of P4G are what coaxed them into releasing more on here. Amazing game, the soundtrack I actually like better than the original.

If you go in with an open mind you'll be pleasantly surprised with what they've done here. While it won't have a great level of tactical depth as a turn based Persona game, stringing combos together, pausing the action for a moment to bring out your persona and use an ability, it's all very seamless and well done. I'm enjoying the game so far, it really is a bonafide Persona 5 sequel (not Persona 5 Royal sequel). \n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nI am 18 hours in so this is an initial impression. The premise here is fine, we are basically moving themes from corrupt adults doing whatever they want to fulfill their own selfish desire to social media being a bad influence on young adults and making them do awful things to get over their complex and escape the judgement of their peers. Perhaps at the end of this there will be an in-depth commentary on the effect of social media on our collective psyche. It is serviceable enough in retaining attention, however, without going into explicit spoilers, I do find the recycling of some of the motives that compel the phantom thieves to do what they do to be frustrating. \n\n[h1]-Graphics-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Very Stylized \u2705\n    [*]Supports up to 4K \u2705\n    [*]Borderless, full-screen, windowed options \u2705\n    [*]Some text does not scale well at high resolutions \u274c\n    [*]Limited graphical options (bloom, motion blur, AA, AO, textures, shadows) \u274c\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Runs smooth \u2705\n    [*]Potato friendly \u2705\n    [*]Coin toss on if you'll play 4 hours without a single crash or one hour and crash 2 times.

You and Morgana returned to Tokyo for your summer vacation, after planning for a barbecue with your friends, you were suddenly thrown into the Metaverse once more...\n---\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat is a combination of both Warriors-series by Omega Force and Persona-series, although it's a lot more similar to \"Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon\", with the fluidity and mobility of \"Warriors\" combat. You'll still primarily press a series of buttons to execute your attacks and strong attacks, however, you can also pause in-combat to use your Persona skills or recovery items.\nEach character, Persona, and enemy have their own kit, strength, and weaknesses. The way abilities are used by enemies will vary for each type of enemy, for example, Mara's \"One-Shot Kill\" would send a barrage of bullets towards the enemy (and 'stains' you for some reason), while Seth's \"One Shot Kill\" would be an explosion. This variation makes for a unique encounter for each enemy. You can obtain Personas by defeating them in the battlefield, or by fusing two (or more) Personas in the Velvet Room.\nThe hack-and-slash gameplay is vastly different than in other Warriors games. Each enemy will also have a \"Knockdown Gauge\" which, if depleted, will knock them down and enables \"1 More\" move and/or \"All-Out Attack\" for the player. You can deplete the gauge by dealing critical hits or striking the enemies' weaknesses. If the enemy still has \"Knockdown Gauge\", they won't stagger at all by your normal attacks, which lets them to counter your attacks by using abilities.\nYou can play as one of four characters that you choose before delving into a dungeon. Each character is actually fun to play, and each of them has certain characteristics in their movesets which are unique to them, which makes for a fun, different playstyle for each character -- something that is missing from modern Warriors games.\n-----\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAh, the story. Before the story starts, there was an phenomenon called the \"Change of Hearts\" epidemic in which some high-profile figures confessed to many scandals, the authorities ruled out the possibility that the Phantom Thieves are the perpetrator behind this phenomenon and started an investigation against them.\nBack to Joker and friends. After planning for a barbecue, they downloaded an app called EMMA, an artificial intelligence guide, which also doubles as an SNS app in which users can become friends with each other by sharing their \"keywords\". Turns out, some keywords will send people's Shadows to Jails within the Metaverse. With the Metaverse's return, Joker and the Phantom Thieves set out to solve the mystery behind it. Along the way, they were informed by a member of the authorities that the same phenomenon is currently happening in Sapporo, and the said member also asked the assistance of the Phantom Thieves to solve the case.\nThe Phantom Thieves decided that they would spend their summer vacation solving the mystery of the Jails and the Metaverse, while also having a road trip across various cities in Japan.\n---\nThe story is a generic slice-of-life anime story with a pinch of \"Shin Megami Tensei\", typical Persona games. The 3D cutscenes and incredible voice acting makes the story interesting enough for me, that I can endure a 40 minute-long series of cutscenes.\nBottom line, the story is pretty good, but the duration of the cutscenes are probably too long for some people.\n-----\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nIf you played both Warriors and Persona games, then you'll want to cross Easy and Normal out of your choices. Hard difficulty offers a tough but fair combat, and you'll risk of actually losing the battle.\nAfter you beat the game and beat the ultimate boss, you'll unlock a new difficulty for New Game+ called \"Merciless\". This difficulty will crank enemy status through the roof, even early Shadows like Pixies and Jack o' Lanterns will easily kill you. Hell, the tutorial Bicorn feels like Chaos-Lu Bu where you can be killed in two hits -- even if you're level 82 with high-tier Personas.\nSo yeah, go with Hard mode for the first playthrough, and choose Merciless for the second playthrough. At least you won't be too surprised by the difficulty jump in New Game+.\n-----\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nCrashes. I experienced more than 12 crashes in my first playthrough, it often happens after leaving the Velvet Room, whenever cutscene background changing drastically (for example, from inside LeBlanc to outside LeBlanc), and leaving dungeons. Some even happen in the middle of a series of cutscenes after a 10 minutes boss fight. I really hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else.\n------\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI had fun playing this game, 54 hours of hack-and-slash-plus-JRPG fun accompanied by an interesting and entertaining story -- makes for a game I would easily recommend to anyone. I hope that I can see another Strikers game again from Atlus and Omega Force.\n-----\nThat being said, please port Persona 5 Royal to PC, Atlus.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "18090de066eb50018c30f30ab4aee4d5", "author": "61b2a86d0505525c91f12ec2e9c888c0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2113, "content": "this game is very very very hee ho good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "17fba387ce045598b1e7f06efded86e3", "author": "8bc51400777d55f0a865d166123d49fd", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 592, "content": "Game is great.\n\nPERSONA!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1762697f548654bd925eb8602894e055", "author": "55b0f49bfc1752a28a8f9b897ed0cc47", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 352, "content": "it's a good game cannot complain that much would i like to have persona 5 royal on pc yeah and yes i have play it on ps4", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "16fbe13dc36757b8ad8f1e62602b20f9", "author": "b6110bc232ac502b82b8a897adf3b5fb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 595, "content": "Good game.\n\nNow port Persona 5 Royal to pc", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "15af169648c45c0b978c264745603290", "author": "b964bcddd82f5b9fae6bb5b73a5d584a", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 475, "content": "Every Silky in my game transformed into a triangle abomination after a few encounters\n10/10, what brave game design", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1579997f72db5475b9e3ef4e031e0b5e", "author": "2fb03e07ab4459aaba08dc5dfec04101", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 90, "content": "Going into this universe again after playing both P5 and P5R is the most amazing feeling ever.

Atlus released a new Persona game on PC? And it's day in date with PS4?! What is this madness?!\n\nBut it's true. If the message to Playstation fanboys didn't come through that Atlus PC ports are here to stay, this does now. This is now Atlus' second PC port they've done themselves fresh off of Persona 4 Golden (which they did a fantastic job on and you should go buy and play that game now. Do it.) Now Koei Tecmo did codevelop the game, but the good news is they had no part in the port at all. It was all Atlus. KT only made the combat mechanics, while Atlus made the rest of the game.\n\nSo how does the port fair? THEY MANAGED TO MAKE A PC PORT BETTER THAN P4G, in such a short amount of time too! Atlus is a newcomer to the modern world of PC gaming, and they're already making ports like seasoned vets. Everything is fast, smooth, and fluid, and runs amazingly. If the port for Strikers is this good, then the eventual port of Persona 5 Royal will be even better. (Seriously Atlus, get on that.)\n\nSo, what is Persona 5 Strikers? Well, it is the sequel to Persona 5, only instead of a lifesim turn based JRPG, it's a musou, but don't let that discourage you. It's a musou designed for people who don't like musous, like me. It plays less like the traditional Warriors games and plays more like a Persona game that's real time action instead. And man they nail the power fantasy. You feel like a slick badass as you slice and dice through massive hordes as your favorite Phantom Thieves. One thing to note: If you're expecting the social life and RPG mechanics the Persona series is known for, you're gonna be sorely disappointed. Strikers is action and action only. Don't let that discourage you from buying it, because when going through the massive levels it plays like a big action oriented Persona game. That's not a complaint, it's a warning.\n\nStorywise, it's really big for what is on paper just a musou spinoff of Persona. The game is a sequel taking place six months after the events of vanilla Persona 5 (so storybeats from Royal will not be present. However the playable Phantom Thieves from Royal will be making an appearance as DLC later in the year.) It is summer vacation and a new threat emerges as wicked evil people are mind controlling people by stealing their desires, and it's up to you to beat them up and all their endless hordes. If you haven't played Persona 5 yet, do so before playing, otherwise you're gonna get spoiled hard, as well as lost on what is happening.\n\nBut that brings me to my biggest complaint of the game, and it's not the game itself, but the release. The Persona series finally broke free from Playstation exclusivity, and everyone is hype off the heels of Persona 4 Golden wondering what's next? Would Persona 5 come next? That's a logical move since Persona 5 is the hot new game everyone's raving about. Well instead, the game we got was the sequel to Persona 5. People really want Persona 5 Royal and have been begging for years to come to other platforms especially PC so we don't have to emulate vanilla P5 through RPCS3 anymore and could support the devs. But instead we got this game, a game that probably won't sell well on PC since we don't have the first game to go off of. My only guess to this is SEGA wanted Strikers to get a PC release first since it was coming out next, and they're basically playing catchup. But man, does it sting STILL not having Persona 5 especially since they know we want it after they made that press release about the emulator C&D. All I can hope is that Royal gets a PC port announced soon, similar to the missing Yakuza games getting announced for PC a month after Like a Dragon released.

The story illustrates the growth of the Phantom Thieves and is fantastic. \n- Killer soundtrack. My favorite is Blooming Villan, River in the Desert, and Counterstrike. \n- Doesn't chug on 60 FPS. \n- The new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, are a fantastic addition to the cast. Usually the new characters tend to hog the spotlight or something but not too much with these two. \n- A Musou game that blends P5's style and system very well. \n- The right amount of difficulty. Once you cleared some hurdles, the game offers you the Merciless option (Risky in JP) and that'll definitely challenge the player's skill (to illustrate how hard Merciless is, you might die in the tutorial if you think you can just waltz in and tank everything). \n- New game plus option.\n\nCons\n- Map navigation might be a bit disorientating at first since you'll be going up and down and all over. I definitely got disorientated at the Shibuya Jail.\n- Inventory management could use some work. You'll be spending a good minute looking for the right recovery mid-fight. \n- You can't jump between Jail to Jail. This might be a bit tedious when you're trying to clear some requests. \n- The chaotic nature of a Musou game might catch some people off guard if they never played one. \n- You won't be able to swap out members mid battle like you did in P5 so if you run into a mid-boss that your not prepared for, you'll have a hard time. \n- A lot of Persona's were cut. This includes the awakened forms of your teammates. \n- Though your main attack is physical, physical Persona moves were nerfed. In P5S, the cost to use the physical Persona moves are based off your total HP and the skill that mitigates the cost of physical Persona moves isn't available. So yeah you can't go mindless and spam Yoshitsune's Hassotobi to decimate your foes. \n\nMix\n- A lot of the P5 casts won't be returning here.\n- Morally gray bosses.\n- The game doesn't really teach you some crucial tips. For example, you can use your items to recover during combat. I did not realize that after a couple of game overs. \n- The bosses are paired with one of your party members for story (for example, Alice and Ann). However, there are two characters that don't have that kind of scenario which is a bummer. However, those two shine throughout the story in general so it's not a total loss.\n- Though it said you'll be going all over Japan, it's more of a slice. I did wish we could explore real-world Kyoto.\n- No DLCs. This isn't a deal breaker (and it's not like DLC = win button) but I did wish we could use P4's Izanagi or P3's Thanatos and jam to Raidou's battle theme. \n- You won't be able to fight against attendants like you did in past Persona games unfortunately (usually they're set up as a hidden boss). However P5S still does it right and prepared a fan favorite of the Persona series as the hidden boss. \n\nConclusion\n- This is a game that I definitely would recommend to anyone who loves P5 or P5R and who's into Musou games. \n- Unlike a generic Musou games, it's very story heavy and won't get as repetitive (definitely a fresh take for me at least). \n- You will definitely tumble in the beginning as you get used to the battle system, but once you understand and master it, it's very fun. \n\nPS\nThe game definitely suffered a messaging issue upon it's first announcement (a lot of people thought it was going to be a generic Musou game with Persona characters thrown in it). After the first and second PV though, I think Atlus got the messaging issue fixed and assured the audience that this was a legit Persona game.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0b3c0aa18ba755f592fb4f87e194ea8e", "author": "8ec83e4c39d55f3487c53058bcb20947", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 580, "content": "This is a great Squeal to Persona 5.

That's not saying it's a bad story line, but it is rather similar and some parts are lifted from the original games. I'll put anything spoil related at the far bottom so if anyones not played, they can't see it. My pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-The combat is FANTASTIC. Going into this, I had a hard time getting used to it, because I was used to the slower combat from Persona 5, but this... hits so hard, literally. The combat feels so heavy, and that in my personal opinion makes games like this great. \n-The dialogue is cheesy at times, but there are so many moments that I laughed my ass off due to comedic timing, and just Yusuke being Yusuke. There are many screenshots I hold dearly from this game of the dialogue. \n-The music is OUTSTANDING. I remember hearing River in the Desert for the first time in Persona 5, and I remember how badass it sounded. But they literally looked at the original soundtrack, took the best songs and said: \"Hey, let's make this more kickass\". Believe it or not, it's more kickass. Rivers in the Desert, Last Surprise and most importantly, Daredevil, the 3rd version of Life will Change if you will. These songs made this game SO good, because you felt the pressure, and high tension. I listen to these songs out of game, they're that good. Also Sophia's shop's theme SLAPS.\n-The art style is so good. The cities you visit feel like a snapshot from real life and pasted into this game with a hint of that really colorful Persona style. \n-The bosses are actually really good. Usually in a game like this, there are a lot of lackluster bosses and the mini bosses are easy and boring. But they did something really interesting with the Request system, where later in the game, you can get requests to beat the boss of the city again, beat really powerful shadows around the area, or just farm. Personally speaking, I liked the Warden system, which are essentially mini bosses before the main boss. They give you a feel for the \"villain\", and give them character, which makes a good antagonist. (Sapporo boss is a meme tho, it's honestly funny to play, but fun)\n-Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are AMAZING. The devs took the idea of All-Out Attacks from the original game and pumped it with CRACK. When you see the way it's used in Persona 5 and can find it a little confusing on how you implement it in this game, and I was there at the beginning, but they managed to make it incredibly smooth, which kind of ties into the combat part, but this is separated because there will never be a better feeling than having finishing a strong shadow off with Ryuji leading an All-Out Attack and finishing it with: \"S E E  Y A ! !\"\n-The fact that you can play as the other characters is so amazing. Ambushing enemies as Yusuke, him saying \"I shall expose you.\" in the most composed matter, man, you can't ask for better.\n-THE GAME DOESN'T END IF JOKER DIES!!\n-Level design is SUPERB. This does tie with the art style aspect, but I just have to shout out how good the Shibuya level looks and sounds. The music and levels work SO well. \n-The new characters are so good man, I can't express how much I love Zenkichi. The way he plays off the rest is so natural and hilarious. Sophia is adorable and we must protect her. \n-It is mandatory to bring up Ryuji saying the F word. (Fun fact, the F word is used twice in this entire game, once by Ryuji, and once by a flashback shadow)\n-They started using 3D cutscenes and they are amazing, please do that more often Atlus.\n\nCons:\n-The animation is a liiitle weird at times. My main issue with this is how lifeless everyone looks when they're chilling in the van or just in cutscenes. At times it was just funny how their blank expressions would never change when they would chant \"Yeah! Let's infiltrate this jail!\". \n-The story is a little strange. It is a typical JRPG at times and it reeeally shows. I'll continue my thoughts further down. \n-The music is a little loud when you first launch the game, and you can't change it if you start a new game after a while of cut scenes, which leads me into my next point:\n-There are a little too many cut scenes at times. It was clear that there were a lot of shortcuts taken with cut scenes and how they skip around. I know this is a nitpick, but with how good this game is, that's really what it comes to. \n-The combat *can* get repetitive, but if you really think about it, that's the same case with Persona 5, but this game is about 40 hours shorter than the original. \n-I did mention earlier that the dialogue is amazing, but there was some dialogue that made me cringe. But then again, it's a typical JRPG in that regard. They could have cut down on how many times they say ones name when that particular person is upset or expressing something. \n-I don't know if this is just me, but I had issues with crashing. There were many times in my play through that I would beat a boss, relieved, then mid cut scene, the game would freeze and then crash. \n-The limited supplied for cooking is frustrating, but I totally understand why they did that, because cooked items are *busted* if you save them for future battles. \n\nShould you play Persona 5 before this? Yes. \n\nIs it necessary? No, but it is highly recommended, due to a lot of references to the previous games (except Maruki, like what) \n\nIs this game worth the price? Yes. I know that's up for debate, but honestly, you can get a *lot* of hours in this game, which is what makes games worth their price. If I'm being honest, I could've spent up to 70-80 hours if I 100%ed it, but I every request except the Prison mails. \n\nIs Deluxe worth it? As someone who purchased the deluxe, I will say that it's not necessarily worth the extra $10, but it is nice to be able to change your battle music and see art for the game. \n\n10/10 Game. \n\n*SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT*\n\n\n\n\n\n-The story is verrrrry similar to Persona 5, in the sense that you fight a god, again. I kind of see why they did that, but it was rather recycled, due to EMMA looking extremely similar to the final boss from P5. Was it fun? Yes, the only reason really is the aspect of splitting everyone into three groups to finish EMMA off. I will give kudos to that, which is a good idea for a final boss. I will say this: The cut scene of everyone finishing off EMMA in an All-Out Attack, is SO good. Everyone got proper screen time, including Haru. \n-Sophia going with Ichinose is so wholesome, it made my heart feel good :)\n-Zenkichi catching Owada is so heartwarming :)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "044b4f116f585ad19d57286d9112cca3", "author": "c30a0a14a59659a2aad130a98a9acc4d", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 969, "content": "have you played the vanilla game or royal? if the answer is no then you shouldn't pick up this game.

The port is very simplistic unfortunately. No ultrawide support, capped at 60fps, and limited settings to adjust (there is an internal resolution scaler though, which can go up to 2.0). The port runs well though - I have an 8700k and a 3080, and I've had basically a locked 60fps at 1440p with all settings maxed and the scaler set to 2.0 (and I haven't hit any bugs yet, but I've only played for a few hours). I imagine that this game will be able to run on a very wide variety of PCs, which is good. One minor complaint I do have however is that the UI is pretty big, and there's no option to re-size it. It's not too much of an issue when running around the world, but during battle it very much gets in the way. \n\nWhat's not good is that you really shouldn't play this game if you haven't played Persona 5 (And like many, I am absolutely baffled that they haven't brought P5 to PC yet. Especially with this game being a direct sequel). Not only will you spoil some great P5 moments for yourself, but this game doesn't really do anything to hold your hand story-wise. It does some very baseline \"story setup\" in regards to the overall world and lore, but it very much assumes that you've played Persona 5 (or are at least very familiar with it and the characters). So if you haven't played, chances are that you'll have no idea what on earth is happening or who any of these characters are. \n\nAs for the game itself, so far I'm enjoying it! I'm not completely sold on the combat yet (which I'll get to a bit later), but the game feels like a legitimate Persona 5 sequel. I don't know how much of a hand that Atlus had in development and how much was Omega Force, but this game feels right at home with Persona 5 in terms of the writing and character interactions. As always, the voice actors have brought their A-game (I'm playing with English VO) and they do just as great of a job as in P5. Omega Force has introduced a few new characters as well, and they all feel like they just fit right in. I'm sure you'll have heard about Sophia by the time you play, and yes - she is as precious as everyone says she is. \n\nHowever, don't go in expecting a full-blooded Persona game. As far as I'm aware, there are no confidant levels, no school, no social stats to level up, etc. While this absolutely feels like a proper sequel in terms of tone and design, just remember that it's a Persona-themed hack and slash game, and not an actual Persona game proper. And with that, we come to the combat! Which is hard to give a full opinion on because I've only played the game for a few hours but I'm going to do my best to give my thoughts as I have them. \n\nConceptually, I love combat (also as a note, I'm playing with a PS4 controller so I'll be referring to it for the button layout). Each character has standard attacks that you'll button mash with the Square button, a special attack (that can be weaved into combos) that's mapped to Triangle, and their persona which is summoned by holding down R1. Hitting Triangle will do different things depending on when it's used in a combo. Using Triangle does something different than if hitting it after hitting Square 2 times, or 3, or 4 (each one presents a different ability). While each character performs combos in the same way (each character has a Square + Triangle combo, a Square + Square + Triangle combo, etc) they do different things for each character, and it can be a bit overwhelming to keep it all straight. However, I imagine that this will naturally dissipate as the game is played for longer. \n\nWhen holding down R1 to summon your persona, battle freezes - this lets you choose your persona/ability and choose the area to deploy it at your leisure. You can switch between any party member at any time if they're in your current party (you're still limited to 4 party members, but these party members can be switched when not in combat), and you can even run around as your chosen party member while in the Metaverse, which I really like. When a typical battle starts, you'll run into one of 3 enemy types: general blade fodder, personas, and \"boss\" personas. The blade fodder are just faceless enemies that you can hack and slack your way through, and don't present any challenge at all. Personas are the personas that we know and love from P5, and this is where you'll want to use the correct party member/persona ability to target their affinities. \"Boss\" personas (I put boss in quotes because it's not an actual boss, they're just tougher versions of the normal personas) can take multiple affinity hits before getting knocked down, and are generally tougher to kill/do more damage. \n\nThere's a lot more to combat, but that's the elevator pitch. Why am I hesitant on it? Because honestly, at times it feels very frantic and unfocused. As mentioned at the beginning, the battle UI takes up way too much of your screen. It's at least 1/4, if not 1/3 of your screen real estate. Add to that all of your party members mashing their standard attack and sending off persona abilities, plus the enemies are doing the same, it results in so much visual overload that I can barely keep track of what's going on. The game recommends trying to use different party members to chain together combos and such, but I can barely keep track of what's going on - there's no way I'll be able to chain things together efficiently. It's also difficult to keep track of your own health - the in-game characters will sound off voice dialogue to let you know that your health is getting low, but sometimes you miss it with the amount of stuff happening on screen and it all just feels a little hectic. \n\nAll that being said, I'm still enjoying the game thoroughly. This is about as close to a \"Persona 5 2\" as we'll ever get, and it's a damn fine follow up. When you're only facing a few enemies and can actually pull off the combos that the game wants you to, it's very satisfying. I'm hoping that my problems with the combat will go away as I get more used to it, but only time will tell there (I'll most likely update this review after finishing the game).
