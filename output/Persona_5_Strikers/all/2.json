The characters maintain their growth and prove how memorable they are through dialogue, the story is a heartwarming romp across Japan, and the music keeps the funky flair mixed with newfound upbeat tempos and hard rock to hammer home the extremely hype show-stopping moments of the game. With a run time of 90-100 hours and then some for those who want even more, the price is well worth it if you are looking for a new action game to sink your free time into.\n\nHowever, the combination of classic Persona mechanics and action game speed, timing, and reflexes, along with some new innovations or streamlined bits, creates a super cool blend of worthwhile progression that is as addicting as it is semi-frustrating. You can only get better at the game by practicing your moments of striking while the iron is hot, but when ambushes effectively end encounters before they begin when the Phantom Thieves gain higher levels, sometimes there are points when you are just waiting to put your button skill and game knowledge to a real test. It is a minor grievance, but admittedly this was an issue on normal difficulty for me. I plan on trying out harder difficulties in the near future.\n\nOverall, this is a must have for Persona 5 fans, possibly Persona/Shin Megami Tensei fans in general who want an electrifying change of pace from the turn-based format that you're used to.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9a0b9d16c42b52088f30f86e5c5a5173", "author": "ca45979fa4aa573986039d50a625d056", "date": "2021-06-14", "hours": 2651, "content": "if you buy this game you will be 7'6\" the next day", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ca7c0efcb7135c6c984cbfb518e1b0eb", "author": "741e5210b9055fe99742a9f53f196088", "date": "2021-06-14", "hours": 5630, "content": "If you want to play a game where the characters are from Persona 5 and the combat is Devil May Cry.

Even though the game was not only using a completely different Fighting system, from Turn based to Warriors Hack and Slash like, AND was made by a different company, the game at large still feels and plays like a Persona game. What Koei Tecmo pulled off to recreate the Persona style is nothing but extraordinary. Many of their previous warriors games, in my opinion, were just plain boring. I am not a big fan of Warriors games, but somehow they made Persona 5 Strikers still feel not only like Persona, but an actual fun game (sorry Warriors fans). Now onto the pros and cons of this game.\n\nCombat: The combat in this game is simply amazing, especially for a combat system that I previously dislike. With the use of not only Personas and the Phantom Dash Mechanic making the combat feel unique and special each interaction, but also each character's unique playstyle and personality, while also staying true to who they are from the previous game. The game always tries to throw in a new gimmick or mechanic into the fight each time you progress in order to prevent the combat from becoming stale. Fighting large quantities imo is just plain satisfying, however fighting one, strong enemy can show the limits of the combat system. The game does try to spice it up with new mechanics, but it is obvious the combat was made for large groups, as slashing only one target doesn't feel as satisfying, and there were a couple of moments where I thought turn based would had made the boss fight more interesting.\n\nDifficulty: the game was simply easy, a bit too easy at times but at the same time, would be hard. It may be due to me doing all the requests in the game, but near the end it was very uncommon to die, as the game had many many, many forgivable mechanics in order to prevent death, while also many of the enemies would telegraph their attack, allowing for alot of time to react and dodge. There was a Merciless option too, but that was only after you beat the game + post-game content.\n\nStory:Im not going to dive deep into the story simply to avoid spoilers, but at large, the story was pretty damn good. Again, wasn't as good as mainline Persona games, but was still really good at the end and gave me the badass feel that the Persona 5 story previously gave me. The message of this game was also pretty good, tackling modern society issues, and having really complex characters, with none of them being just pure good or pure evil, but instead having reasons for their actions.\n\nCharacters: the Phantom Thieves has returned yet again, and I think they still were just as good as in the previous game. They even gave Haru much needed character development that persona 5 lacked in, while also making everyone else more fleshed out, while sticking to who they were in the first game. The New Characters were also amazing, as not only were the new main characters super fleshed out, but also the side characters and the antagonists were really amazing to watch and learn about. There wasn't really an amazing main antagonist like what persona 4 and kinda persona 5 had, but the story kinda went through the same story arc as persona 5 did, and tbh I was fine with it.\n\nMusic: as always, the Persona music is back and better then ever. The OST for this game consisted of mostly remixes of previous Persona 5 music, usually in a rock remix format. There was also brand new music for this game, and they were simply sooooooo goooooodddd. Idk how tf they produce bangers after bangers of music, but they do somehow. There was an issue for the ratio of new music and remix music, as I did feel like there was a bit too many remixes where they could had used a new song, but the remix were bangers anyways so I ain't complaining lol.\n\nSmall Nitpicks/Positives:\n-LOVED how this game felt like Persona 5: Sequel, with just a new combat system.\n-PC controls were awful, I had to remap a shit ton of buttons in order to make it playable. In the end I got it to work and made if playable, but there was still some issues I couldn't get rid of like how the camera was just either too damn fast, or too damn slow to rotate. I know the game was made for controllers, but whatever I am just that kind of guy.\n-The Voice mixing in this game was all around the place. Most of the time, it was pretty good. Sometimes however, the Voice actor would be too quiet, too loud or even have a drop in quality as if they didn't have any noise suppression. It was especially obvious during the beginning segments, like how sometimes even the character's audio would be so damn quiet I would have to repeat them, which just sucked. It was however pretty obvious it was due to the Voice actors having to record remotely due to Covid-19, so I think they get a pass in that regard.\n-from persona 5 to persona 5 strikers, due to the combat change, some things were nerfed or majorly buffed indirectly. The SP pool was still pretty small, that was just a 5 thing in the series and its back in strikers. However, items are just 10x better in this game due to not only having huge quantities to buy in the shop and around the city, but also due to now being able to pause the game and chug a shit ton of potions and food without the penalty of it taking a turn like what the previous persona games did. IMO I wasn't a big fan of this, as it did kinda slow down combat, but it was different due to the combat, and there wasn't much to do in that regard except maybe nerf the amount of items.\n-The game also had weird PC port things alongside it. Its obviously a console port of a game with things like 60 fps lock, game logic pauses when you don't focus on the window, till you go back into the game, and even with max details, the game seemed to have an anti-aliasing issue, with characters and further away objects just looking pretty pixelated imo.\n\nIn conclusion, the game was still really damn good, especially for a persona spinoff title. This is most def the best spinoff title from the entire persona series, but I still think the turn based combat should stick for the mainline series going down. Even though I really enjoyed this combat system, it did have its limitations, especially with large boss fights that the other system didn't lack. Of course large quantities was better in this system, but hey. Other than that, this game is especially worth to get if you played Persona 5, as this is just a continuation sequel to that game. If you are a first timer however the game is still really damn good, but you maybe lost in the story element and characters as you don't know who they are and what they did before, as they especially make tons of references to the previous game. I still think you can go thru this game w/o persona 5 experience, but I still highly recommend playing Persona 5 First. The length of the game took me around 50-55 hours, which also included me doing all the requests that was allowed in first playthrough, which is a really damn good length and so worth the price of the game (idk why people complained it was too explained like ok lol).\n\n8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan), really damn good game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9e1deab5733f53b999bbddc6b6f9a272", "author": "5fae6cf363ab59f8952c8c0df558a42f", "date": "2021-06-13", "hours": 704, "content": "Great game!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c3bf022aa0a5ae9b9c2d2a4579c1f3b", "author": "ae2d99f2697051a3b405a6c865f2e374", "date": "2021-06-13", "hours": 6143, "content": "Out of all the persona franchise games I've played, Strikers is probably my new favorite!

Just be warned that there is lots of button and mouse mashing ;-; The play style is also very different than what is characteristic for persona games which are typically turn based, but I actually really liked the style used in strikers, as it was more engaging and action packed.

Strikers does not contain content from persona 5 (The) Royal such as new characters.\n\nPersona works like final fantasy in that each entry in the series is self contained but shares elements between all of them. Personas (The spirits/demons/manifestations you summon to help you fight) and other mechanics work similarly across the other games but the story can be understood and is grounded on an individual basis.\n \nPersona 5 in particular is inception meets anime and Persona 5 Strikers tosses the turn based combat system for a real time fighting game with a story centered on travel around Japan. Outside the dungeons you advance the story and prepare by obtaining items such as healing or buff single use items and equipment and accesories that affect stats and damage. In the dungeons you manage your energy to clear objectives advancing towards the goal of stopping people from hurting people, just like base game 5. \n\nYou have a nice full team with different fighting styles you can swap between but you're really gonna stick with the main character, Joker, due to having the most direct power progression and for him being the character who's perspective you'll experience most of the story from. As soon as the game gives you the chance I recommend just learning how everyone works. Exp sharing is on I think but people will still lag behind I think. You'll want everyone about the same power.\n\nPersona as a series knows how to use a great deal of subtlety, but it's main ideas it will remind you of often, and loudly. The great music being the best example (Im looking at you \"wake up, get up, get out there\" from 5!) The story is about many things but remember growth and understanding are at the center. It's very anime, trust the power of friendship. \n\nMy main enjoyment of the games' stories is that they help with introspection of ideas by having a wide range of approaches presented to you with many of their consequences and logical/emotional fallacies shown clearly.\n\nGameplay wise: Hit those weaknesses! Your auto combo does different stuff depending on which persona you have and each enemy has different weaknesses. Thanks to free abilities with certain persona combo attacks if you have the skill you could go entire boss fights not spending any energy- if you manage to survive that long and have the patience, otherwise press the persona button to pause the game and aim an ability. This uses SP which less items and abilities recuperate easily. Keep a wide variety of attacks available, fighting without hitting weaknesses gets expensive fast and every time you leave a dungeon to recuperate the enemies re-spawn.\n\nPersonal recommendation for a game mechanic I wish I knew about sooner, accumulated power: If you feel low power in the game fuse more personas towards your level cap. Don't be afraid if a persona becomes a lower level than the cap from a fusion, it will eventually get more stats the more you fuse the resulting persona. \nIf you do a newgame + run...check the guides.\nHaru best girl don't @ me.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5cf3cad0c61c5d45add979ac630b9faf", "author": "223a6203c08059ee863d1e85d2c316a6", "date": "2021-06-06", "hours": 4446, "content": "Imprescindible para todo aquel que le gust\u00f3 el Persona 5 original o el Royal.

The combat was surprisingly fun for me, as I don't really enjoy this particular genre of gameplay (previously played Dynasty Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors), but it isn't good enough if you don't know anything else about what is going on in the game. \n\nBut I am a fan of P5 and the Persona franchise, so I really enjoyed spending more time with these characters and meeting new ones. The story is good enough but I was craving a more personal connection between the plot and the heroes. The story was more intimate and impactful in P5. \n\nWhat I missed most from P5 was the time management and relationship building portion of the game, but this did make Strikers much easier to get through and it was a very focused experience. So while I would have liked to see more of this in a Persona game, I ultimately don't think it took much from the experience.\n\nSo an easy recommend from me, with the caveat that I think this game has a very specific audience.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "201263a9a231578a8ab84ba0a68a72b6", "author": "90caa607516e5e9695fdc02f0c5be151", "date": "2021-06-06", "hours": 3737, "content": "Great game if you are into persona series, I really enjoyed it wish there was more personas like satanael so i give this a 9/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7050ac8bb01b557a822b4e48e6ce9677", "author": "bb0bf1a4d2a85e0fad413846d07f1cf0", "date": "2021-06-06", "hours": 4600, "content": "I really enjoyed the hack'n'slash take on persona.

Now, I highly recommend you at the very least watch a playthrough of the original Persona 5 (Or Persona 5 Royal) first before picking this game up, as it's a direct sequel to Persona 5. I won't be covering the story of Strikers much in this review either.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5, you once again play as Joker, as you and the rest of the Phantom Thieves travel around Japan for the Summer. That's pretty much the premise.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from the mainline games, Persona 5 Strikers is a Hack and Slash with RPG elements. The gameplay itself I found quite fun, and I definitely found a few of the battles a bit challenging, even on normal difficulty. \n\nOne of my favorite parts gameplay-wise is that I never ever felt the need to grind for experience. I never felt too underleveled or too overleveled. The game also reintroduces Persona fusion. And while not as vast as the mainline games, it was still quite robust and intuitive. Dare i say, some aspects of the fusion I liked more compared to Persona 5. \n\nWithout getting into it, the story was really good, on-par with most persona games. I found myself invested in not only the characters i'm familiar with, but also the newly introduced ones. And there were a lot of moments that made me visibly happy, sad, angry, and so on. And that's a sign that they did something right.\n\nContent-wise, this game has quite a bit. It only took me roughly 40 hours to beat from start to finish over the course of four days, then again I played it practically nonstop when I bought it. I'm a bit of a Persona fanboy, haha. \n\nI do also plan on completing this game 100%, definitely. This game has quite a lot you can do in it, even in post-game you still got some stuff left.\n\nThe english voice acting was fantastic. I plan to play the game again in Japanese to compare, but I just LOVE the english voice cast so much, some of the deliveries were on point, and I laughed out loud quite a bit at many lines.\n\nOf course, I can't talk about a Persona game without addressing the best part about the series. The music.\n\nGood GOD the music. It's fantastic! The music is a LOT more fast paced compared to the mainline games. All the battle tracks get me absolutely hyped to fight. And the remixes of songs like Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert, among others, were done amazingly well! I could listen to each track for hours and NEVER get tired of it! \n\nI did yoink the deluxe edition though, which means I got two DLCs along with the base game! So I'll cover that next.\n\nThe first DLC was the all-out attack pack, it gives you a bunch of skill cards, along with 10,000 Persona points you can use to level personas up. The skills cards were nice, but also a bit unnecessary since the game is quite generous with it's skill cards, doesn't really justify the need for the price tag. \n\nThere's also the BGM DLC, it adds tracks from various persona mainline games. In my opinion, this is the better DLC option of the two. Changing the BGM can help change battles up a bit, and the fact that they remixed the battle theme from Revelations: Persona just for this game says a lot to me.\n\nThe Deluxe edition also came with bonus content on the side! Such as the soundtrack, a digital art book, and Behind-the-scenes footage! Which I find really cool! Watching the footage gives you a glimpse as to how much passion went into the game, and I enjoyed watching it!\n\nNow that all that's been said, let's get into the issues I had with this game, it's mainly bugs and small issues though.\n\nOne of the biggest things i experienced was audio issues, in-game audio was cutting in and out, along with crackling and stuttering. This is most apparent when I went to shop for things and bought things over and over in quick succession, or when I was in a menu like the compendium and scrolling down from the top to the bottom really quickly. This also happens in animated cutscenes, which kind of breaks the flow of everything, unfortunately. It never happened that often during normal gameplay, but it was often enough to the point that it ended up being really distracting, Although it was extremely rare, the game would also crash, which definitely was a bit frustrating when it did happen. A smaller thing was various instances of voiced dialogue not matching the text box, and lastly, audio balancing with the english voices. Sometimes the english voice acting is hard to understand, they sound too quiet, even had to turn the music down so i could hear the voice acting. This was mostly apparent with soft spoken voices. I'm not too mad at the audio balancing though, since they were recorded during a global pandemic, so that's something I can let go. That's pretty much it with my issues. \n\nAll in all, if you don't wanna deal with the audio issues and rare crashes, then I recommend getting the PS4 version, as it's probably the best version of the game. But if you don't mind the issues and want the convenience of having it on your PC, or you don't have a PS4 or Switch, then get this version, it's still worth it! The game is not only a fantastic one, but it's also a fairly stable port! I didn't ever have any problems with framerate either, which is a plus! This game receives a 9/10 from me!", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "243f930c20b755b1b38f618ab3b627bd", "author": "acf08c784bac50b787c59735cc805a36", "date": "2021-06-05", "hours": 1757, "content": "", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9ff062a7e032580ea2f7c5d4975e962b", "author": "4447c5759a1e5f0d9a5babd6ccd6d444", "date": "2021-06-05", "hours": 640, "content": "my game 100% starts up", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "146480aef7935ea383183f8147a3ff15", "author": "bd71b761581d56dd8bcd5ac8da724e0c", "date": "2021-06-05", "hours": 5922, "content": "Certainly cop this if you have played P5 first... updates also have seemed to have resolved most of the crashing issues that were at launch.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "022d9e6285d35d15a24f9a5b5d9b2f40", "author": "faf52d76f5a054189574d753d0a21b86", "date": "2021-06-04", "hours": 4283, "content": "This game was a blast, it is a different styled persona in comparison with the others but overall has unlimited fun into it. My thoughts on it:\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful visuals and animations\n+ Fun and entertaining gameplay\n+ Zenkichi being a cutiepie\n+ Mechanics are smooth and very fun to play with\n+ Sofia is wholesome\n+ i could go on and on with the pros in this game, personally loved it\n\nIn my own experience i found nothing to be too annoying in the game but some small things are: \n- Not many personas. The game has plenty of personas dont get me wrong, but i would love to have seen some more personas as in the riders or some of the other dragon personas as in seiryu etc.\n\n- In combat you will find yourself sometimes flying around the place doing attacks which can confuse you or put u off guard on which button combo you are doing as u may be in the boss a** and cant see anything.\n\n- In combat sometimes when activating a phantom dash to connect an attack it would register the dash on a minion 5m away from the target you are going for, even if the target is right in front of u sometimes it will do this, but not as much so its not that big of a negative.\n\n- Game is fairly small, even tho i have 70 hours on it, still it feels a bit small especially when playing in new game+ where u will end up skipping dialogue and cutscenes. I played a new game+ run and completed it in a single day. But nonetheless not that big of an issue, when playing for the first time it will net u a good 50+ hours which isnt bad at all, and it all depends on how you progress the game ( in a good pace or not )\n\nOverall this is my 3rd persona game i played from the series, the first i ever played was 5 and my current favorite being 4, i say its a solid game just like the others, managed to even 100% this alongside persona 4 golden, so for the achievement hunters out there i would recommend this game as its mostly grind than difficult, but not as grindy as persona 4 golden or persona 5.

Dopo mesi in cui hai lasciato da parte la tua avventura su Persona 5, il gioco ti propone di ritrovare i tuoi \"vecchi amici\" seppur virtuali e incamminarti con loro ricordando i vecchi tempi e rafforzare sempre di pi\u00f9 i tuoi \"LEGAMI\".\nIn conclusione Persona 5 Strikers fa anche un notevole passo avanti graficamente e le colonne sonore sono sempre il massimo ma queste note positive non influiscono molto sul voto finale che seppur supera la sufficienza non raggiunge il massimo a differenza dei suoi predecessori.\n\n7.5/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "69fcbfbc1a3457918065b491245dd92e", "author": "23d82df61b945c0490be0fcfbbeb9ba9", "date": "2021-06-03", "hours": 4178, "content": "very good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "859fc36343455c498565d603e3784688", "author": "d3aa052d8f39550fb7c02ef8a6453151", "date": "2021-06-03", "hours": 1488, "content": "Just play this game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "93fa6d8f6b3b514192ad37a629819d1a", "author": "7ead540edf425c17b5d14958fa00fd57", "date": "2021-06-03", "hours": 3164, "content": "\uac13\uac9c \uc6d0\uc791 \ud32c\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc120\ubb3c", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a19ef80d0da75d43bbfab7cf6ac18a0b", "author": "6b57c4c26dd05c13a436790c75929116", "date": "2021-06-03", "hours": 3981, "content": "Gran juego, buena historia, muy de la mano del Persona 5 original, excelente banda sonora y gran apartado art\u00edstico. \n\nEl gran \"pero\" para este juego es que, si no jugaste al original, no vas a sentir la magia y la chispa entre los personajes y no vas a captar del todo la historia, ya que este juego es como reunirse con unos amigos que no ves hace tiempo, hablar y hacer cosas que hicieron en el pasado.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "48261eee366a50d8be49803d83025a36", "author": "ca3baf1d83105c25b1d251325fca21b5", "date": "2021-06-03", "hours": 4573, "content": "Never played a \"warrior style\" game, but it's Persona so i bought it.\nTook some getting use to but as i got the hang of the gameplay it was great fun. \nHaving only just finished Persona 5 Royal for the first time, it was nice to see the Phantom Thieves again so soon. \nI was experiencing stuttering problems a little but i enabled Borderless Window and that seemed to fix it.\nHere's to hoping Atlus continues to port Persona titles onto PC!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 14, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "101fcb9197325de4b50c482f70d3b34f", "author": "002f5a88425f54beb6118524b65642a0", "date": "2021-06-03", "hours": 984, "content": "I love it", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2ed4e75cf2325de09d9363fb4353540e", "author": "24663a53964c5ee7823f094be3c8bd1f", "date": "2021-06-02", "hours": 1421, "content": "Ryuji swears!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 69, "funny": 11, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0428df546e3f592fac7ab3a3d8d08430", "author": "4dd9a913a56357af85320ff26a0cf22f", "date": "2021-06-02", "hours": 2858, "content": "Pelo menos n foi 300 reais em fifa", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 16, "funny": 13, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b0123d5cc52555bfaa83871d5edfd871", "author": "44f08270ee3b50868df4dc3f43bab9a1", "date": "2021-06-02", "hours": 5150, "content": "I loved this game so much!

They've managed to fit the feel of Persona combat into a completely different battle style and genre, as well as to a point the overworld investigation parts. The overworld parts being extremely bare, but that's understandable with how many different towns they implemented. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and the character interactions it made happen which are one of the big things about Persona.\n\nMy only complaint is one of the dungeons is so long, they make new Requests available mid dungeon without needing you to leave for any reason. It felt like a really long stretch of just doing combat things. It needed some kind of mid dungeon story break point but that's just me. And it's only the case for one dungeon, all the others feel well paced and well designed.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "272d56a3fa0d5ee6b3a3edd59a275c14", "author": "4facfda3971c5f00ab4d021b8ad638f6", "date": "2021-05-29", "hours": 752, "content": "I think the robot girl is funny", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f27d96efda4d5c16bf119ebefee25458", "author": "ae0677d1095f584da65918fe1cde020f", "date": "2021-05-29", "hours": 9002, "content": "Middle aged man has a mental break down over a cat", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 177, "funny": 110, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b3913e1c53ae535187b5884c96f7f25d", "author": "be3d4a133a0755bfbb6f7358796ea7a6", "date": "2021-05-29", "hours": 2747, "content": "\u771f\u7684\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9609\u5272\u4e86\u597d\u611f\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u65b0\u52a0\u7684BAND\u6280\u80fd\u4e5f\u662f\u53ef\u5708\u53ef\u70b9\uff1b\u5267\u60c5\u662f\u5bf95\u7684\u5347\u534e\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53ef\u4ee5\u5410\u69fd\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u90a3\u53ea\u662f\u94b1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u8fc1\u6012\u8fd9\u4e48\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7d20\u8d28\uff1b\u6bd5\u7adf\uff0c\u94b1\u4e48\uff0c\u7eb8\u4e48\uff0c\u82b1\u4e48\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "409aa1db407c59dcbdcc429813370733", "author": "159085f64c785e7f8fb6e7f15f7758d2", "date": "2021-05-28", "hours": 305, "content": "Persona 5 Royal when", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3a0083537aec5effa346e4b33aefcff2", "author": "5e02a46880df5e5ea4b9b132a95f445b", "date": "2021-05-28", "hours": 3871, "content": "combat? great\n\nmusic? banging\n\nmerciless? merciless\n\nnow port royal to pc pls", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c86d32a84b9653929a1f05bc984145f3", "author": "d5468aaabace5a618068fc236b11409f", "date": "2021-05-28", "hours": 5394, "content": "JUST AWESOME DUDE GO BUY IT IF DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0e8936e2f5975e5ebc08166496264993", "author": "3f9d14c8c2c755209c7ec19ea757374e", "date": "2021-05-28", "hours": 3971, "content": "Salve tizio che guarda le recensioni, andiamo al sodo.\ntutti dicono che P5S sia la copia brutta di P5R o peggio ma non lo \u00e8. \nil gameplay ''3D'' \u00e8 perfetto, basta abituarsi e il grinding non \u00e8 tantissimo, abbastanza per proseguire la storia che \u00e8 bellissima, con cutscenes 3D e scene Anime-type. la grafica pu\u00f2 essere modificata in-game (cosa ottima) e il prezzo \u00e8 un po' altino (circa 70 euro) ma con degli sconti stagionali si possono ricevere un po' scontati.

That being said, SAVE OFTEN.\nSP/persona skills seem unbalanced, especially on Merciless mode; you have to use skills multiple times to break \"shields\" on bosses, let alone down them for an all out attack, but the amount of SP each character has is similar to P5/P5R, where this is not the case. Endgame often turns into a case of spamming persona attacks and SP items (the grind for SP items is real, especially since shops don't restock unless you do multiple battles in the metaverse)\nSome controls are a little wonky (such as all-out attack, phantom dash, follow-up attack, interact, etc. all being triggered by the same button, with limited ability to create separate hotkeys for them). This seems to be a symptom of poor porting from console.\n\nYMMV (i.e. some info that may be a pro or a con depending on the person):\n\nNo confidants/social links, no time management (you can leave and re-enter the dungeons at any time to replenish HP and SP with no detriment), no turn-based combat (i.e. missing many Persona gameplay staples)\nThis is a direct sequel to P5, NOT P5R (and the story very much reflects this)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1dc1212ff02d5bffbfe8e67f92dba439", "author": "ec817f079f935f7d91a3ef1e24c861b6", "date": "2021-05-28", "hours": 9141, "content": "After completing this game I can recommend it to pretty much anyone who liked persona 5, this game is prety easy to get into the swing of battle wise and each character has a different playstyle so everyone can feel at home (I ended up liking Joker the most).

It takes what people loved about the characters and atmosphere of Persona 5 and made a sequel that was very enjoyable, but I will start with some problems I had. First off I can't really recommend this game to someone who hasn't experienced the story of Persona 5 in one way, shape, or form. The game does a good job of relating back to certain things in the plot for context, but you may not feel very connected if you don't know the content from before.  Secondly, the combat in the early game feels very repetitive, and not very satisfying. My friends who also played this game felt the same for some confirmation. You will need to start getting stronger and more versatile Personas before you start getting into the good stuff. This is an RPG so that's a given, so if you thought you could mash through the game it won't be that easy. Lastly, the story is kind of stale for the first chunk and feels like you're getting nowhere. Once the Phantom Thieves start piecing together the signs and make their way towards the bigger baddies, the story gets very good, very fast thankfully. This leads on to the good parts. The game looks fantastic on PC. The effects and landscapes pop with color and are a pleasure to look at. Also the mid-late game story is very good, along with the ending being very nice. An absolute plus is the post-game content. There are many requests you can do for stronger weapons and fighting harder version of previous bosses for a fun challenge. Though I had my issues I highly recommend this game to Persona fans, but give a smaller recommendation to new comers. Very fun, maybe wait for a price drop. 8/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "571d0da163cd5d5096a224409abce26f", "author": "2530ed5eacba5eb0ade199b8993fe702", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 4146, "content": "good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "42b9df6d26195d03a5ade5df29a0fc68", "author": "621fba905fc8555aae25767c0d3ad0fd", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 3889, "content": "Zenkichi best girl", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "65328813c25454feb051bfe09a34105a", "author": "f7f5e16855405411b15617a05b47b2b1", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 1681, "content": "   \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "04d7184971a3542f9fd82038597e6849", "author": "9c92b4362f4357b9af72e4e4ddea4c15", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 2069, "content": "tr\u00e9s bon jeux, un peu long dans les dialogue par contre, et un peux brouillon sur les combat", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "471c2e3f751d52e3ae291e4ef10edff7", "author": "8ecb9e3ef9a559d1b9dd22959da13463", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 6933, "content": "\ubcf8\ud3b8 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac! \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2a4\ud0ac\uad6c\uc131! \uc758\uc678\ub85c \uc190 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac00\ub294 \uc561\uc158!\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub09c \uc774 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc758 \ud2b9\uc0b0\ud488\uc744 \ub2e4 \uad6c\uc785\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4! \uc785\uace0! \uc785\uace0\ud574\ub2ec\ub77c!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "17ab8ed8c19e5a1796d2eb22fa0a60da", "author": "812d961e1a455a4592726aaddb122521", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 5105, "content": "You'll never see it coming", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3957ea011e735b029a290a26a90384d1", "author": "167450c9fb8f586c947f2d9b09048fd3", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 5203, "content": "Both the best Warriors game, and least warriors game.\n\nPersona strikers is a sequel to the vanilla persona 5 that plays with the hack and slash combat of dynasty warriors.\nstory wise this doesn't have any plot points related to persona 5 royal.\n\nquick questions:\n\nWhich version should you buy:\nEither buy the game one PC or PS4, don't bother with the switch version. PC and PS4 are so similar it just comes down to your preference, on switch, the loading times are like waiting at your local dmv to retake your license photo while the old man is yelling at the girl behind the counter on why he can't show an ID to confirm his states residency so you just have ti sit there until he finally leaves so you can get your picture done and move with your afternoon.\nIts bad.\n\ndo you need the deluxe edition?\nNo. Unless you intend on doing multiple playthroughs and need variety in the music, there isn't any point to it. the all out attack pack gives you some resources that'll make the early game easier at the start. but after that, you'll be swimming in resources, so really your just paying 10 extra bucks for legacy music.\n\ndo you need to play any other games prior to starting this?\nNot unless you want to. Play persona 5 or watch the anime, you won't be super lost here. the game tells its own story that takes place a few months after the events of persona 5, though your not going to be drowned in call backs and references to the previous game. Its got a few places it takes itself for a persona game thats a fun ride, least to say, you'll be entertained if you're in the camp who just loves persona for its story\n\nHow difficult is the game?\nPlaying on normal mode, its fairly simple and wont beat you to your knees after the first couple hours. you might feel starved for resources at first, but after the first dungeon is done, you'll be fine. Worst case, if you fight tougher enemies without their weaknesses in your party, the fights will just last another 15-ish minutes.\nOnce you go into new game plus however, your characters will die in only a couple hits. Its doable, though a clear difference.\n\nhow long is the game?\ndoing a single playthrough on normal mode with doing every side quest, and most achievments, just over 50 hours. For completionist 86-95 hours since you will have to grind a small amount near the end.\nI 100% the game 86 hours and didn't feel like I was grinding at all until the last 3 hours. By far this was one of the most enjoyable games I've 100% as the pacing really doesn't struggle to keep itself together.\n\nNow for everything else:\nHow different is this game from normal dynasty warriors & persona?\nbesides throwing out turn based combat and the traditional calendar system, your able to freely come and go from the games dungeons as much as you want at no penalty to you.\nYou wont need to manage keeps and battle enemies in hordes and dictate who should target what, rather you have a set map you can be stealthy and fight enemies in with your 4 party members (who can be switched with the entire cast outside of battles ) will join the fight. killed a handful of enemies and move on. \"Keeps\" from dynasty warriors have been reduced to simply plot points on the map rather than a part of the map to take that you dont wanna lose.\nthere's a clear simplicity from the usual warriors spin off here and its all the better for it.\nPersona fusing is here again as you'll be getting sacrificing personas to keep yourself going.\nall the party members are useful this time around and you'll use them all fairly regularly through the main the main story.\n\nfinal verdict: 10/10\nTLDR: a solid hack and slash that doesn't feel like tedious, even into the games final moments of completion.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 36, "funny": 5, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f1e160c5783541c9da5453062ca77be", "author": "f4f69e4059a55ca0bd40188b69c58760", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 4844, "content": "I started playing this game immediately after obtaining the Platinum Trophy for P5R on the PS4.

There are a lot (and I mean a lot) of references to P5R that make you connect more with the plot if you know what they mean.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that Ann completely forgot about being my GF xD", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9d82355e20c959629597650e3a884a4f", "author": "fc4d5833ca36568f8b0a1853c1e4eb6a", "date": "2021-05-24", "hours": 730, "content": "Muito bom", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b17df3ff96dc5fcaabefacc3214f69bd", "author": "ed0f7fc2d903543ea5730b10d0d54090", "date": "2021-05-23", "hours": 1906, "content": "makoto is cool i guess", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ac73fe573ba45d1e94ad8617c19dfefa", "author": "403c492dc1825adb8e3be7c57efa40a4", "date": "2021-05-23", "hours": 1938, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the Vanilla Persona 5 (PS3/PS4) game NOT Royal. With that being said, to enjoy the full experience of Strikers. The player must've played/experienced the Vanilla Persona 5, since there's a lot of inside jokes from that game. \n\nThis time around, Strikers is a Hack&Slash with some JRPG mechanics. Due note that there's no S-Links, no romance/dating options, and there's a lot of cutscenes. What makes Strikers unique from the other Warriors games is that it requires a lot more strategy. Meaning early game the player can't just spam magic attacks - which requires SP (Skill Points) to win every battle. Remember this is an Atlus game, they make their games difficult in the beginning to make sure the player understand the game's mechanics. \n\nJust like the other Persona games, there is a calander system.... eh kinda. While there are events in the game, Strikers is a very story heavy game. Even if the player exits a dungeon, no time/day will pass. Days only progress when the story progresses, so no need to worry about deadlines. There are some Social events that play out and trust me you'll want to get these events. Bonds are what replaced the S-Links, but these serve to improve/upgrade combat and gameplay. \n\nOverall, my experience with Persona 5 Strikers was a great one. I've 100% completed this game 3x (PS4, Switch, and pretty soon Steam). I will say there's an achievement called \"Eternal Bonds\" that takes forever to complete. Even though my playtime shows 30 hours, the game itself is about 45-50 hours (I skipped the cutscenes on steam, but not on PS4) its a lot of content for those who enjoy anime and/or Persona mainline games. I'd highly recommend it. Yes it works with the PS4 controller", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id":

I thought I was going to enjoy this game more because of the real time combat but in all honesty, this game doesn't give me that \"oomph\" when you land a critical or hit a targets weakness. P5R always made me feel like a badass every time you showtime a group of enemies and in this game it isn't really all that effective. Especially since the bosses tank that shit like it's breakfast.\n\nP5-P5R is just better IMO.

They just don't do anything for me, but P5S managed to keep me engaged enough that I didn't really care what kind of combat I was dealing with. The battles were a bit more than just mashing the square button and had some variation based off yours and the enemy Personas which was nice. I think my biggest complaint is that the EXP share isn't a flat rate so you're forced to change out party members every 15 minutes if you want them to stay roughly the same level (which you do need to do).\nI could go on and on about the combat, but likely if you're buying the game, you're more here for the characters and setting. \n\nIt was great to have the gang back together (minus Kasumi and Akechi), and overall the plot was really enjoyable. Another thing this game did great was the setting. I thought I would be super bummed not being able to run around Tokyo but all the new locations were super detailed and interesting. I also have to say all the new characters are fantastic. I only wish I got to see Zenkichi and Akechi bounce banter off of each other.\nThere was also some more character development. Nothing ground-breaking but they did give it to characters who could've used an extra couple of minutes in the spotlight (ex. Haru)\n\nAll the new music was great. Obviously a lot of what you hear is recycled from P5 but that is no big deal since P5 has arguably one of the greatest OSTs of all time.\n\n\nDon't expect to drop another 150 hours into the game like you did with the original P5 or P5R as there's just not that much side content, and story isn't nearly as long.\nThe game will net you about 45 to 60 hours depending on if you care about being a completionist.\nOverall 8.7/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b3177662e645567aa63bbc220cfced95", "author": "7971b9b7e91058c481ce79e69f883fdb", "date": "2021-05-17", "hours": 4673, "content": "Zenkichi my beloved", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 27, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e79046721b22532facc2dfa9bebdcf6f", "author": "b3a23f8b8edf5a269feaaf6de4e28f2c", "date": "2021-05-17", "hours": 3411, "content": "If you loved Person 5 (Royal), this is an excellent sequel.

They don't gripe about adults every 5 minutes, they don't complain about society every 2 minutes and they also don't talk about how much better they are than everybody every second. I don't know if this game is great or if my low expectations after P5 make it seem great, but I do know that I want the combat and the writers back for Persona 6. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nUnlike P5, this game has active real-time combat as opposed to turn based combat. P5 tried to ad flair and look cool but it fell flat because the characters ended up just standing still and taking turns in combat. The sense of progression and picking the right persona for the job is still here, but with combat that seems to fit the story better. You have basic attacks. You have special persona attacks you can weave in with the basic attacks, and you have your normal persona abilities you know from the mainline series separate from that. This is what persona 5 tried and failed to make you feel, strong and powerful in the face of an army. There are also no more punishments and subsequent incentives to finish a jail in one day. No more time management YAY :D Time management was my biggest gripe with P3-P5, but it's not here.\n\nSTORY:\nDo you want to go on a cross country summer tip with your friends? me too :,( This is just a group of friends doing exactly that, kinda. Saying it's a rehash of P5's story would be a disservice, but it really does feel like the writers saw the potential in it's story and rebuilt it from the ground up. No more cartoonishly evil villains. All of your \"enemies\" are all shown to have suffered greatly and as a result their desires have been twisted. In P5 they were \"twisted\" because the story demanded it. No more \"I know whats best for society\" main-characters. In P5 they were pretty much just like the main villain, but were never called out on it or made to think about it.\n [spoiler] The main \"villain\" this time is actually just the Phantom thieves, but on a much larger scale. He points out that they can't help everyone, that even now while they are talking people are suffering. He want's to become a hero for everyone, to help everyone the phantom thieves can't. His way of doing it is to basically brainwash people, and remove freedom entirely (just like the phantom thieves can be argued are doing to their targets) and when it is pointed out to him that he is basically erasing peoples humanity and becoming like the figure who traumatized him he relents. I am a bit sad that no one pointed out to him that he was punishing the innocent majority for crimes committed by the guilty minority, especially since there was a cop there, but compared to P5 it is flawless. [/spoiler] \nThe characters never stop interacting with each other, so it really does feel like a friends group out on a trip. P5 did little to make them actually seem like friends that would hang out outside of Phantom thieves business, and while this does little to remedy that, it does pair all of them off to some degree. So while they may not keep contact with everyone, they will at least keep in contact with someone. I can see Ryuji and Yuskuke, Futaba and Yusuke, Ryuji and Ann, Makoto and Haru. Just like a real friends group, some of them seem to hit it off better than others. This felt lacking in P5, but there were at least more contained single stories I suppose.\n\nMUSIC:\nYeah, it's pretty good. Some remixes from P5 to make them fit better with the real-time action combat. The jails all have personal BGM as you are walking around just like P5. The first jail has an absolute banger of a track, while the others do their job of building atmosphere well enough. The last one can be argued is alright. The battle music really gets the blood pumping and get you ready for a fight. It makes what happens on screen just feel that more sick. If you bought the battle tracks from the other persona games as well, then you get a good amount of music to make sure you never really tire of any one of them. \n\nFINAL RATING:\nStanding on it's own: ?/10\nCompared to P5: 11/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a17c808b1e965f9aa3dc64167cf81cdb", "author": "32d50e8451455780850bd1813ba1cfe2", "date": "2021-05-16", "hours": 1033, "content": "This game is asshole", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0fcbdfa2195c5fc48ec79a520469c7c6", "author": "5c4cf6858db95db5a2939d9eed6efd71", "date": "2021-05-16", "hours": 1924, "content": "ryuji says fuck\nthats all you have to know", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6bc23bb655005f59871d66432f2adfbd", "author": "60f05325fc485aabb21ac7036c269d3e", "date": "2021-05-16", "hours": 7746, "content": "good\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "be4fcabd5d255355a329785f4b4e5dc1", "author": "c8cd8ae195ba567b8d484a2161b70e9a", "date": "2021-05-15", "hours": 4927, "content": "perfect", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7e489ff80d7850ce881a88670736526c", "author": "cde941609d4a53fba3ab2a66933dc041", "date": "2021-05-15", "hours": 953, "content": "\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u80fd\u5168\u5c4f\uff0c\u4e00\u5168\u5c4f\u5c31\u9ed1\u5c4f\u3002\u4e0d\u80fd\u5168\u5c4f\u9f20\u6807\u8001\u662f\u6309\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u680f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5427\uff0c\u4e3a\u5565\u8fd8\u6ca1\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "862a130b2bc5577eba601bec4c6b4464", "author": "490214f6742d56e6956e7a750cbb8e6b", "date": "2021-05-15", "hours": 1812, "content": "Persona 5 strikers is a very fun and exciting journey into a more grounded style of persona gameplay.

Writing is expectedly weaker than the main game (as is with Persona spin offs), but the new characters and group interactions pretty much make up for it. I'm not afraid to say Zenkichi is one of the best Persona characters and he carried the whole game. Sorry, it's the truth.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay, back when this game was announced, a lot of people were expecting this to be another mindless button masher like a lot of the licensed Musou games are, but P5S is far from that. Battling enemies incorporates P5's dungeon exploration mechanics to present smaller (when compared to a normal musou) but still fast paced encounters between big numbers of enemies. The addition of elemental magic, buffs and debuffs from the turn based games grants the gameplay a new layer of depth and more ways to deal with enemies other than melee attacks. There is some grind, but it never feels like a chore because the combat is really addictive and super fun.\n\nAs for the rest of the game's elements: amazing soundtrack (as is to be expected from Meguro) and vibrant and stylish UI and overall presentation. My only complaint is that the antialiasing implementation is terrible and if you don't force it with external tools, the game will look blurry and ugly. The port had some serious issues when it came out but most of them seem to have been fixed with the latest patches.\n\nSo, all in all, this is an amazing game. Bit of a hard sell to people who didn't play the original but for those who know what they're getting into, this will be one of the best experiences in the Persona series.

Sin embargo si ya sab\u00e9s eso y lo que quer\u00e9s es sacarte la duda de si comprarlo o no, entonces espero que mi rese\u00f1a te ayude a decidir.\n\nJUGABILIDAD:\nTengo que aclarar que nunca hab\u00eda jugado un musou en mi vida, y le ten\u00eda un poco de miedo por la fama que tiene este g\u00e9nero de ser tan repetitivo, sin embargo me llev\u00e9 una buena sorpresa cuando jugu\u00e9 P5S porque, por lo menos en la primera run, no me pareci\u00f3 repetitivo en ning\u00fan momento. Tenemos muchos personajes con muchas habilidades distintas para probar, e ir cambiando de vez en cuando a tu grupo hace que las batallas se sientan frescas, y no s\u00f3lo eso, cada batalla la pod\u00e9s abordar de una forma distinta usando tu arma a distancia, cuerpo a cuerpo, persona o combinando todas, y eso adem\u00e1s combinado con poder ir cambiando de personaje en cualquier momento.\nSin embargo todo ser\u00eda raro sin escuchar nada m\u00e1s que gritos mientras apretamos botones, y ah\u00ed entra lo siguiente de lo que quiero hablar, la banda sonora.\n\nBANDA SONORA:\nNo me alcanzar\u00eda una vida para hablar de lo buena que es la m\u00fasica en este juego, demostrando una vez m\u00e1s que Lyn es una cantante excelente que se adapta a muchos estilos. Al ser un juego de acci\u00f3n la m\u00fasica es m\u00e1s fren\u00e9tica que en los otros Persona, pero queda igual de bien, sin contar que tenemos un compositor original para este juego que, sin ser Meguro, logra captar perfectamente la esencia de lo que es la m\u00fasica de Persona 5. Cada uno de los temas, especialmente los de Lyn, quedan perfectos para el juego y no podr\u00edan haber hecho un mejor trabajo para las distintas situaciones en las que suenan ([spoiler] premio especial para Counter Strike. Escuchar esa canci\u00f3n mientras luchas contra Akira es una de los momentos m\u00e1s \u00e9picos que puede ofrecer la saga Persona en general. [/spoiler]). Realmente yo me comprar\u00eda el juego s\u00f3lo por los temazos que tiene y lo bien incorporados que est\u00e1n. \n\nHISTORIA:\nEn cuanto a la historia no quiero decir mucho para no spoiler nada, pero en resumen los ladrones fantasma se vuelven a reunir para hacer un viaje en donde las cosas se terminan doblando hasta tal punto en el que volvemos a entrar en el metaverso a combatir contra los jefazos de turno. En el medio se nos suman dos nuevos integrantes que aunque aparezcan en el trailer y en la animaci\u00f3n del inicio no voy a mencionar por temas de que alguien quiera entrar \"virgen\" al juego. S\u00f3lo voy a decir que su incorporaci\u00f3n es clave para que se desarrollen situaciones geniales y nuevas. Hablando de personajes, premio para Yusuke por ser el m\u00e1s carism\u00e1tico y gracioso en mi opini\u00f3n. \n\nDURACI\u00d3N:\nLa duraci\u00f3n del juego no es tit\u00e1nica como el anterior, pero si te tom\u00e1s tu tiempo para las cosas y quer\u00e9s terminar la historia principal con todas las secundarias hechas, entonces f\u00e1cil pod\u00e9s sacar 70 u 80 horas.\n\nDIFICULTAD:\nLa dificultad es algo de lo que quiero hablar brevemente y es que no tengas miedo en jugarlo en dif\u00edcil. Se aprecia mucho m\u00e1s el combate en las batallas m\u00e1s largas y no es tan complicado. El problema es que Normal es muy f\u00e1cil hasta para el que nunca haya jugado un musou, aunque algo bueno es que la dificultad se puede cambiar en cualquier momento, as\u00ed que pod\u00e9s ir primero en normal y si ves que te resulta muy f\u00e1cil lo pon\u00e9s en dif\u00edcil, y si se te complica en dific\u00edl lo pon\u00e9s en normal.\n\nREJUGABILIDAD:\nPor \u00faltimo y en temas de rejugabilidad, el juego en s\u00ed no tiene mucho contenido nuevo cuando empez\u00e1s el new game +, pero si te gusta sacar todos los logros o conseguir algunas cosas que te dejaste y no pudiste agarrar, entonces se puede pasar otra vez y es igual de disfrutable, y es mucho mejor cambiando el BGM de combate en el men\u00fa ([spoiler] volver a pelear con Take Over, que se desbloquea luego de pasar el juego, es demasiado bueno. Simplemente una puta obra maestra para pelear. [/spoiler]). Igual no recomiendo lo de sacar todos los logros, el farmeo extremo que hay que hacer es bastante molesto.\n\n\nTerminando, Persona 5 Strikers no es s\u00f3lo un spin off, es una secuela con una historia original, jefes y palacios (que ac\u00e1 son c\u00e1rceles) nuevos y con un dise\u00f1o igual o mejor que los del P5, personajes nuevos y carism\u00e1ticos y localizaciones nuevas y variadas. Una compra segura si sos fan del P5 (si no lo jugaste no vas a entender muchas cosas), te lo aseguro. Sin embargo el precio completo por lo menos en mi pa\u00eds es muy caro, as\u00ed que si no te encant\u00f3 la entrega anterior y s\u00f3lo lo quer\u00e9s para ver c\u00f3mo sigue la cosa, la m\u00fasica o el sistema de combate, entonces esperar\u00eda a una rebaja, aunque desde ya te digo que vale el precio completo.\n9/10.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 42, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b2194533c88f541b9bc1ad865a203335", "author": "8235e208f3a05ecf927f0cfc2a3ce7be", "date": "2021-05-13", "hours": 5829, "content": "With the Jazz and the aesthetic this game really reminds me of Persona 5!

It is a sequel, so prior knowledge of Persona 5 is required to get the full experience. Of course, you could still play the game as is, but be warned that there are a few spoilers here and there so I would advise against it.\n\nGameplay wise, it is different from the traditional turn based style the Persona series is known for, that being Persona 5 Strikers is in a style of a musou game with Persona mechanics. This was my first musou game so it took a while of getting used to, but it was fun steamrolling through waves of enemies, and with Persona 5's flashy style and gameplay mechanics, made it a much more enjoyable experience. \n\nIn terms of story, I'd say it's pretty good although that could be my bias towards Persona 5 in general. I do think that if you enjoyed the prequel, you would enjoy this one as well. (I don't really want to say much as I can't really explain without spoilers, sorry.)\n\nLast of all, I want to talk about the PC port. For me, it ran perfectly fine for the most part, but it could be by many factors such as with the new patch (1.02), my hardware, and etc. \n\nFor those who want to know what my hardware I'm using, I'm using a Ryzen 5 2600 and a RX 580.\nThe GPU driver version that I'm using is 20.4.2.\n\nThroughout my playthrough the game only crashed 1 or 3 times but they were at minor parts (like an event with hanging out with Ryuji and Ann near the beginning of the game) so I'm glad it was mostly fine for me and I hope your experience goes smoothly. My computer also didn't suffer from the \"infinite black screen\" bug in the 5th Jail. I would advise to save whenever you can, just to be safe and to keep submitting your game issues to Atlus so that they could look into it and hopefully bring out another hotfix if you are still experiencing issues.\n\nOverall, this is a great sequel to an already great game, and I would definitely say give it a shot if you liked Persona 5 but wanted more content. \n\nWith the success of sales with this game, I hope Atlus and SEGA can continue to bring more of their games on to PC and multiple platforms. I personally do not see the point of having third party game exclusives as bringing games to multiple platforms will not only would bring in more sales, but it can introduce many people to their franchises, and it can make them more popular than they are now.\n\n:D", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1d31800bc329594dbadf51d7c080ef34", "author": "09f8c3ac6a645bd4b3284058040f1cb8", "date": "2021-05-12", "hours": 1862, "content": "\ubb34\uc30d\uc561\uc158\uac9c \uc911\uc5d4 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud30c\uace0\ub4e4 \uac70\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ub9ce\uace0 \ub35c \uc878\ub9b0 \uc218\uc791\uc778 \uac74 \uc778\uc815.\n\uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5c8\uc73c\uba74 \uad73\uc774 \ub610 \ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc740 \uac8c\uc784.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e72d736a82aa579393a510c59aa46b93", "author": "5dc2644a77e25320ae9263105db77d2e", "date": "2021-05-12", "hours": 1461, "content": "Granted this game may have its fair share of bugs that have to do with loading for long times, so you have to play in full screen.

The story was alright but could have been better, the combat felt more of a chore than something you would look forward to and that is not something you want in a game. The bond mechanic and bond skills were slow and knowing that strikers takes place after persona 5 it dosen't make since that they would have to create a bond when they spent the whole year of p5 doing that, most character felt like they lot lost a lot of their character development. I regret buying the game this is not a bias because i was not bad at the combat because i played on hard mode and even then the combat was just right it was not the time i spent playing it\nIf this is going to be your first persona game don't buy this rather buy persona 4 then 5 and if you still want more play the older 3 games then come back to this\n\n<Edit> The games only redeeming quality is the second to last boss fight he is a Dilf that dresses up as a poweranger", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9071791e414e5e418b51db98eba2ba6e", "author": "2a65f0ab64b15f9a94fe9ca1c5fac2f3", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 6057, "content": "\u4e07\u80fd\u8def\u897f\u6cd5+\u53cc\u5373\u6b7b\u65e0\u654c\u65e0\u8111", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d0daf44667c153ff8d3993286fda27e1", "author": "03e1147c41315fd6a1b2c117ca30367d", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 5567, "content": "this is the most fun i have had in a persona spin-off/sequel thing.\n\nso whens persona 5 racing?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c33e69ae1b9f5ad995792ae7e23babf2", "author": "e1f57278e1b75a7a9a9c5cc2c52c9943", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 4848, "content": "muy bueno el juego, la historia es agradable y tiene buena mecanica", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ab9e58dcebdd503c881bd67de0cba4a6", "author": "83795ec903da56119b0e89ed0c8566c5", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 2212, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a weird game.  The original game was a turn based rpg but this is a action game with rpg elements.  Think Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy 7 Remake.  Strikers is an actual sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not even Royal but the original Persona 5).  Also the original game is still only available on PS4 so if you don't have a PS4 and want to experience all the story before this point you are going to be shit out of luck.\n\nAll this weird shit out of the way, the game is pretty dang good.  Gameplay is fast and tactical. Lots of fun combos and can weave in persona abilities in-between them.  The music features some original compositions as well as tracks ripped straight from P5. The remixed battle themes are probably the biggest highlights here.  Story is entertaining but can feel a bit too familiar if you already have played Persona 5 before (even the characters will say, \"Hey didn't we do something like this before?\")  The new characters for the most part are pretty well written and interesting.   Voice acting is great.\n\nNow for my complaints.  This game can feel a bit too long especially with the story being predictable.  This isn't necessarily a complaint but I felt like more risks could have been taken here.  I also feel like there is not a huge variety of personas compared to all the other games.  There are a lot of cool ones here but it feels lacking.  A lot of the side quests are also pretty bland and lack creativity.  Kill X guys with X character repeat x50.  \n\nSo yeah, game is fun.  Kind of a hard recommend if you haven't already played Persona 5 as you will be in the dark in quite a lot of details especially character relationships and words like \"Metaverse\" or \"Palace.\"  I would definitely recommend if you already played Persona 5 and are open to action rpg games.  7.5/10\n\nAlso Atlus just put P5 on steam already.

It was a really amazing ride and took me around 50 hours to beat. \nAnd well I'll be listing some pros and cons as well as some personal \"feelings\" down the end. Keep in mind, I'll only list the really important parts in this review. SPOILER FREE REVIEW! \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[b] * Good story [/b]\nThe story in this game is pretty damn good and works perfectly as a sequel. \nThe Phantom Thieves reunite again to steal the hearts and desires of even more adults on a \"roadtrip.\" That's about what I can say without spoilers. \n\n[b] * The gameplay and 60fps! [/b]\nUnlike all the other Persona games, this one isn't turnbased. It's a hack and slash type of game, but it does it kinda differently. You'll still have to hit the enemies' weaknesses to do more damage and stun them, meaning you still have to think, it'll just be a bit more action-paced. And the combat is also really satisfying. Oh. Did I mention that this game is actually in 60fps? No 30fps cap. \n\n[b] * Visuals and cutscenes look better than they've ever been! [/b]\n[b] * The level design [/b]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] * The repetitive story. [/b]\nThis story is really good! But! This Persona game does like every other Persona game, it keeps the same formular in the story. For example, in Persona 5/Royal you go and infiltrate palaces, but most of the palaces are made for you to get another teammate on your team. While this game doesn't exactly do this, it does it in a similar way. You go to jail, turn the shadow good, and then leave again, only to do the same process over and over. While this ain't THAT bad, I really hope that the future Persona games will improve on this. This is why the last bosses in Persona are always so good, because they're so different. \n\n[b] * No social links [/b]\nMakes sense, since this is a very linear game in comparison to Persona 5. Still, I've always loved the social aspect of the Persona series. Sucks that it ain't here since it's what made Persona 5 into my favorite game. \n\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\nI really enjoyed this game and I think it's a GREAT sequel. (With a few flaws.) If you love the Persona games (or just love Persona 5) You'll like this game, 100%! It might not be AS good as Persona 5/Royal, but it's still worth playing!", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "be55153b27c45d81acc8177bb94a5251", "author": "62e1fd723195545d8d5f8a0f62000441", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 2685, "content": "Makoto", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d8900ffddea55a9084bde42a0c8164e5", "author": "c28d812cd7df5e6eb8a578a6ba861fb1", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 3733, "content": "p5\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00 \u5e0c\u671bp5r pc\u7248\u80fd\u65e9\u65e5\u4e0apc", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 9, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f065c66477ad5172870d2dba4a7c9dd5", "author": "c75c730a76c650d1a824c7dbbf99072e", "date": "2021-05-11", "hours": 3419, "content": "ngl, Imma keep it 1hunnid wit ya'll.

It's very much a sequel and, while a certain character effectively plays the role of the \"newbie audience surrogate\", the terminology thrown around can get confusing.\n\nThat being said, it's certainly a worthy sequel to Persona 5. Nowhere near as good as that game mind you, but still excellent.\n\nLike its distant cousin Hyrule Warriors, this game takes the basic \"warriors\" type formula and stretches it in new directions. As a result, it plays way more like \"Persona 5 but an action RPG instead\" than it likely should, and that's great. Everything that makes the battle system of Persona 5 tick is here as well... All the elements, all the skills, a pared-down-but-still-in-depth fusion system... It's remarkable what they've done here.\n\nThe gameplay loop begins to get a little stale as the game goes on, but it smartly switches things up a little bit midway through.\n\nMy most major complaint is that the midbosses and bosses are a huge slog unless you have the correct characters in your party. If you don't, you might as well just let the midboss kill you and switch your party out on the retry, otherwise you'll be wasting all your SP healing items on Joker and have to grind until you can get more to replace them. Unlike in Persona 5, there is no ability you can get to switch your party members out in the middle of the battle.\n\nAnother complaint, though more minor, is that there are audio mixing issues all over, with different characters being louder or softer unexpectedly. But conversely, the characterizations of the party are excellent, with the VAs getting to play a lot more with how their characters talk and behave. And there are just as many \"funny\" moments here as there were in the equivalent time of playing Persona 5.\n\nTLDR: Excellent game, excellent sequel, a few issues, still absolutely worth a full

They took the rough Dynasty Warriors/Musou template, merged with the SMT framework and Persona 5 specific features (baton passes, One More attacks, etc), loaded up each Phantom Thief with a moveset unique and fitting to them, and set you loose.  Combat is fast and fluid, while still being tactical and having that SMT lethality that you expect.  On an overall systems level, they kept what made sense from the base game, while removing or replacing bits that wouldn't make sense (ex. Social links, strict time scheduling).  The result is a game that's paced well, has a lot of challenging and fun encounters, but rewards your growth and skill over time (and your ability to fuse personas with elemental drains and physical/gun attack skills in tandem).\n\nPlotwise, P5S is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (Royal content notwithstanding) and follows a similar enough trajectory as bit of a mirror to the Phantom Thieves' previous Metaverse adventures.  Strikers has the Phantom Thieves go on a summer road trip around Japan dealing with mysterious Jails that are appearing in concert with minor change of heart outbreaks.  In short, it's exactly what you'd expect from your favorite loudmouthed idiot social reformers on vacation, with some hilarious moments and the usual levels of \"Morgana makes stuff up about the Metaverse that ends up being accurate\".  Haru in particular is a riot due to not being saddled with the worst introduction plotline in the base game, and the new additions to the roster fit right into the group dynamic.

Can't recommend it after 10 hours, though. I don't want to continue this. Note: I have not played Persona before, but have watched it on Twitch regularly and roughly know the plot. Also, I'll try to be the devil's advocate here, but don't blame me if I get a little worked up.\nPros:\nThere's no doubt it has awesome cinematics, cool fighting mechanics and controls well. I like Anime. Occasionally, I'll watch one. It's tiring though, how in every new Anime, most of the same ideas always get recycled. Persona, on the other hand, does a good job to come up with interesting new ideas and the characters all have a unique charme to them.\nThe palaces are really fun. I like the hidden chests and objects, the relatively unique combat ideas and the Persona system.\nI played the game on normal mode and it is very well balanced. Plus, the music is great. I do believe some people are overrating the music, but it's still really spicy.\nCons:\nHear me out; I already mentioned that I like Anime. I, too, can invest lots of my time into deeper story and plot analysis. However, if I wanted to play a visual novel, I just would've. The dialogue scenes are cool at first, but they get so boring. At the same time, neither have any of my dialogue 'decisions' made ANY difference on the plot whatsoever, nor am I really willing to completely 'skip' all of them since then I'd have no idea what's going on. And the plot is what people always praise the series for, innit? I don't think it's bad to have long dialogue sequences, but they really OVERDID IT with the frequency. I've spent less time in dialogue sequences in all Life Is Strange games that have been released...\nFurthermore, one is SO limited! I can't underscore this enough. You can't even explore one shop, one sideroad, one small area without any of the characters becoming professor oak lamenting about it 'neither being the right place, nor time'. I have to strictly follow the game's idea of how it wants to be played. It's frustrating. Why, devs? Well, in Pokemon Red (1999) at leat you could enter Pokemarts. Well, ATLUS didn't even bother to animate that in 2021. Again, where is the love? If the game is set in Tokyo, at least try to make it feel like there's a cool shopping experience you can have. The food and medical items you can buy in Persona 5 Strikers are basically all the same (When it comes to TP and SP restoring), they just have different names. By the way, 'Donut-Worry' (restores some health) is the only item/thing in the game that has made me chuckle. Though likeable, the convos are never really... funny. Yeah, the don't have a good sense of humour.\nThe areas are well designed. The artwork and visuals fit perfectly. In Tokyo and other places like Sendai, however, you'll see the same 9-10 character models all the time. Humans in this game appear to be nothing but strange hollows without even a glimpse of a soul. I just really wish they (the devs) had spent more time creating a world that's actually vivid. I wish they had taken more time to make this a good game.\nThe skill tree in this game is ridiculously uncomplex (It's the complete opposite to a game like Final Fantasy X). It's not interesting, it's not individual, and it's not really challenging your decisionmaking/brain either. Heck, they don't even make you do a small minigame or the like when you cook for the rest of the party. \nHyrule Warrios, for anyone who's played that, really sucks at the plot part. But at least I get to PLAY the GAME. And I don't want to wait until I've gained freedom of movement potentially towards the end game. That's simply not a point.\nWe're in 2021 and still nobody expects your game to be as detailed as, say, the Witcher III (2015). In Contrast, with games like The Witcher existing (not a 60 Euro title by the way), how can you even legitimize putting so few love into your towns that you could basically copy from reality and didn't have to make up entirely.\nConclusion:\nI have to add, that the voice acting in this game is superb and the writing too. As english is my second language, I quite enjoy the narrative and style. To be honest, I could probably forget about the cons. Well, if this weren't a 60 Euro game, that is!\nI bought this game on Sale (52 Euro for Digital Deluxe) and that wasn't even worth it. I think at it's current state, the game isn't worth any more than 25 Euro, for there is a huge lack in love for the design of player independence. And hence they try to make it seem like your decision matters in conversations, you can't tell me they're not actually trying to establish the illusion that you do have some independence in this game.\nSince I'm done with school now, soon to be studying at university and thus am short on money, I'll have to continue this game. I merely don't have the money to buy another one. I'll come back to this review once finished. \nIf at all, please keep the comments neutral and respectful.

[/strike]\n\n\n\nTL;DR: It's a good game, and I don't recommend it for those who haven't played/experienced Persona 5 in any form or fashion.\n\n\n\nP5S is a great sequel for both the base and the Royal re-release versions of Persona 5. Admittedly I [i] am [/i] biased, as I fell in love with this game series since Royal's release and quarantine's abundance of free time. \n\nIt has more of the characters that you love and more of the strategies you employed in P5, all wrapped up with fast-paced hack n' slash gameplay and a decent story that adds new characters that I'll refrain from mentioning any further. If this is your first game with the Phantom Thieves, I sincerely recommend that you [i] not [/i] start here, as all the pre-existing characters are already established in this sequel, and the game wastes [i] no [/i] time re-introducing them or their character arcs. If you don't understand what's going on from the beginning, you'll have to catch up on a lot in your own time, or just run around like a headless chicken and beat the h#%l out of the computer pixels with your skillful excellent button pressing.\n\nMy first run-through of mastering the game (Finishing the story and completing [b] all [/b] of the requests, side-bosses, etc.) took me exactly 69 [spoiler] nice [/spoiler] hours and so-and-so minutes on Hard mode, though I certainly took my time.\n\nI also went through a Merciless NG+ run (only available after Mastering your first run) to finish my achievements list and unlock more powerful [strike] psychological Pok\u00e9mon [/strike] Personas, I finished the achievement list at my current playtime (130.0 hours). While I do love this game, I'm not the type to normally enjoy NG+ runs and that more or less remains the same. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you [i] absolutely [/i] thought the game was too easy. Though be warned, it may feel a lot grindier than the normal Easy/Normal/Hard mode runs.\n\nOther notable things worth mentioning:\n[list]\n[*]I only played on controller, and I recommend you do the same if possible. I'm not familiar with MnK controls, though I hear they're not the best. That preference is up to you, of course.\n[*]The music, as always, is a banger. And has been remixed to fit with this game's faster, more action-oriented combat.\n[*]The fusion system, the Velvet Room, and obtaining masks work somewhat differently compared to P5/P5R, though personally I didn't find the changes of serious significance.\n[*]There are [i] no [/i] Confidants/Social Links, in its place are the traditional RPG-like leveling up of skills, and Combat Mastery by playing different Phantom Thieves.\n[*]Speaking of which, you're able to play as any of the Phantom Thieves almost immediately. Each member has their own special variation of combos, and a unique combat skill that can alter your approach to a fight.\n[*]Unfortunately, no waifu is canon. But (actual semi-spoiler) [spoiler] a certain 5head bestgirl(?) may or may not get more screentime [/spoiler]. \n[/list]\n\n\nAll in all, Persona 5 Strikers burned my bread, revealed the troof, and stole my heart. I lost the mutual respect of my friend groups after they saw me jump into the Persona sinkhole, and after 100%'ing this game I can tell you I've only sunk in further.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "049e08f6cf6250e1b8fb67d2ada12c8d", "author": "81831057983553a191ee07bbd344414a", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 1696, "content": "back for more Persona 5 experience after 2 years and thankfully this game ain't letting me down", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6c7ccc76db045e7ab933f2de06c36f9c", "author": "f0766e6a214f576a82275e58b07a6383", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 3737, "content": "p5r\u5462\np5r\u8981\u6765\u4e86\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b5c45e0d3f385f1b8b70d808f23d11ee", "author": "f3b79e08a76f5485ac73780ac7a49ccd", "date": "2021-05-07", "hours": 1780, "content": "Persona 5'in b\u00fcy\u00fck bir hayran\u0131 olarak bu oyunu be\u011fendim. \u00d6ncelikle bu oyundan zevk almak i\u00e7in orjinal Persona 5'i bitirmeniz gerekiyor.

If you like Musou games, you will probably like this, if you don't, but you enjoy persona 5, you might still enjoy it, given that it does differentiate in some aspects\n\nIt plays like persona 5 in the sense that you get to wield personas and it adds a somewhat complex layer to the game\nHowever,  it's pretty boring as far as action games go. It's an average at best game covered with persona 5 elements that makes it seem better than it actually is.\n\n It lacks the polish most persona games have. The bad guys are bland, the main cast interactions feel sameish all throughout the game, the side missions are tedious as all hell, honestly it's a very unrewarding experience. There is no calendar system, there is no confidants, the difficulty is inconsistent... It's just not persona, or a fun game for that matter.\n\nIt's not good. It's not bad either, it's just ok!

Da w\u00e4re es wohl besser gewesen wenn man sich gleich beim Checkpoint heilen k\u00f6nnte.\nAnsonsten gibt es spielerisch nicht viel zu tun, wie erw\u00e4hnt gibt es zwar auch ein paar Nebenquests zu erledigen aber die bieten nichts besonders und bestehen nur aus Sammelaufgaben oder dem erledigen von bestimmten Gegnern.\nDie Handlung ist auch nichts besonders und \u00e4hnelt dem Vorg\u00e4nger etwas zu sehr, daf\u00fcr mochte ich aber wieder die Interaktionen zwischen den Charakteren und die Truppe der Phantomdiebe ist mir mittlerweile recht ans Herz gewachsen und auch die Neuzug\u00e4nge wissen zu gefallen, nur manche etwas \u00fcbertriebene Fanservice und Animeklischee Momente h\u00e4tte man sich sparen k\u00f6nnen.\nWas im Spiel aber auch recht gut r\u00fcberkommt ist der Reiseaspekt der ganzen Handlung der f\u00fcr recht abwechslungsreiche Schaupl\u00e4tze sorgt.\nGrafisch ist das Spiel vom Design wieder \u00e4hnlich stillsicher wie der Vorg\u00e4nger und die einzelnen Elemente flie\u00dfen gut ineinander \u00fcber auch wenn ich es vielleicht einen Tick weniger gut gelungen finden als im Orignal.\nDer Soundtrack ist daf\u00fcr mal wieder fantastisch und bietet ein paar coole Remixe von der Musik aus dem Vorg\u00e4nger hat aber auch ein paar gute neue Songs.\nDie englischen Sprecher machen auch wieder einen guten Job und die deutsche \u00dcbersetzung geht zum gr\u00f6\u00dften Teil in Ordnung auch wenn sie manchmal etwas eigenwillig wirkt und einen recht offensichtlich Tippfehler in den K\u00e4mpfen hat man bis jetzt leider nicht korrigiert.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dd6faab23dec5e0bb8efe45f0804ea21", "author": "35c784a935b45ee7ba6063087f9db922", "date": "2021-05-06", "hours": 1322, "content": "(je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que j'ai beaucoup jou\u00e9 au jeu en hors ligne et qu'actuellement je suis \u00e0 une cinquantaine d'heures de jeu) .\n\nGameplay : \u00c7a n'a rien en commun avec son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur \"Persona 5 \"Royal\" - On passe d'un jeu au tour par tour \u00e0 un Muso. \u00c7a peut en d\u00e9cevoir certains mais sinon c'est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able de faire les combats en temps r\u00e9el (On peut se d\u00e9placer dans les niveaux avec n'importe lequel des protagonistes et on peut enfin sauter !). Chaque personnage a ses points forts et ses faiblesses, \u00e0 vous de les d\u00e9couvrir et de les utiliser dans les meilleures situations (m\u00eame si on va tous constamment utiliser Yusuke). Les phases dans le monde r\u00e9el (hors combat) sont plus simplifi\u00e9es compar\u00e9 \u00e0 l'opus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent mais c'est justifi\u00e9 dans le jeu et \u00e7a n'est pas tr\u00e8s d\u00e9rangeant. (Un petit plus pas des moindres mais on peut refaire les boss d\u00e9j\u00e0 vaincus sans passer par des vieux fichiers de sauvegarde !).     10/10\n\nDifficult\u00e9 : Les phases d'explorations ne sont pas bien compliqu\u00e9es (on peut tr\u00e8s facilement se soigner ou regagner de l'\u00e9nergie apr\u00e8s voir pendant les combats. N\u00e9anmoins, les boss et certain mini-boss repr\u00e9sentent un certain challenge n\u00e9cessitant de la strat\u00e9gie et de l'organisation pour gagner.     8/10\n\nGraphisme : Ce n'est pas le dernier God of War en mati\u00e8re de graphisme... et tant mieux ! La patte graphique (style \"anim\u00e9\") rend le jeu magnifique et les jeux de couleurs (beaucoup de couleurs vives) sont bien g\u00e9r\u00e9s. Mention sp\u00e9ciale a l'interface du jeu qui est toujours aussi unique et r\u00e9ussie !     9.5/10\n\nHistoire : Ce n'est peut-\u00eatre pas du niveau de P5 mais \u00e7a reste tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussi quand m\u00eame. On a envie de continuer pour mieux comprendre l'univers dans lequel on \u00e9volue et quand bien m\u00eame le principe du jeu est tir\u00e9 par les cheveux (voyage dans le m\u00e9taverse, etc.) il reste logique dans son monde. Histoire int\u00e9ressante et les personnages sont toujours aussi attachants !     9/10\n\nDur\u00e9e de vie : Je vais une fois de plus comparer le jeu \u00e0 son grand fr\u00e8re mais ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 la m\u00eame dur\u00e9e de vie de jeu que celle de P5. Le jeu est plus court (l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je mettais plus une dizaine d'heures par niveau dans P5R, je mets de 4 \u00e0 8 heures dans cet opus). Estimez environ une quarantaine (mot le plus d\u00e9test\u00e9 de 2021) d'heures pour finir l'histoire principale sans les qu\u00eates secondaires.     7.5/10\n\nRe jouabilit\u00e9 : \u00c9tant un jeu relativement \"court\" avec une m\u00e9canique de jeu dynamique je dirais que si vous finissez le jeu une premi\u00e8re fois, il vous faudra attendre au moins quelques mois avant de vous replonger dedans.     9/10\n\nPerformances : Le jeu tourne tr\u00e8s bien sur mon PC Portable (RYZEN 5, Nvidia GTX 1650). Il m'est arriv\u00e9 seulement une fois durant tout le jeu d'avoir une chute de Fps (tr\u00e8s courte) \u00e0 cause d'un trop grand nombre d'ennemis sur l'\u00e9cran et d'un ordinateur portable qui n'a pas les configurations les plus r\u00e9centes.     9.5/10\n\nMusique : Les musique de ce jeu sont I N C R O Y A B L E ! Vous prenez les excellentes musiques de P5(R) et vous les modifier pour les rendre encore plus epic. (il n'y a pas que des reprises). Les th\u00e8mes des niveaux sont tous super ! Rien \u00e0 redire c'est un sans faute.     10/10\n\nNote finale : (9.06) -> 9/10\n\nCommentaire : Si vous n'avez pas jou\u00e9 \u00e0 P5 o\u00f9 P5R ne jouez pas \u00e0 Persona 5 Strickers, c'est la suite du premier jeu donc vous n'allez pas avoir la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience de jeu qu'une personne qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait le premier. (suite uniquement de P5, ne tient pas en compte les \u00e9v\u00e9nement additionnels de P5R). Si vous avez du mal avec le style Muso mais que vous adorez l'univers de Persona, je vous conseille de lui donner sa chance (je ne suis pas un grand fan des Muso et pourtant j'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 !).

Den ganzen Tag ist man damit besch\u00e4ftigt, durch die Gegend zu gurken und in irgendwelchen Restaurants die Gerichte auszuprobieren, gearbeitet wird da eher selten. Aber was verlange ich auch von Teenagern? Na ja, schon ein wenig mehr. Die Bande sitzt den ganzen Tag in ihren Van herum und quatscht, anstatt die Kraft der Jugend auszunutzen!\n\"Wir haben einen neuen Monarchen gefunden!\", ruft Yusuke und h\u00e4lt die T\u00fcr zum Auto auf. Ich seufze und schlie\u00dfe mich der restlichen Gang an, denn ich wei\u00df, was mir bevorsteht: Die n\u00e4chsten zw\u00f6lf Stunden werden wir beengt aufeinander h\u00e4ngen und alles tausend Mal durchkauen. Selbst Themen, die wir schon besprochen haben, werden immer wieder aufgew\u00e4rmt und nochmal besprochen. Obwohl wir alles genau wissen, sagen wir immer wieder, dass wir uns nicht sicher sind und dass wir mehr Informationen brauchen, also teilen wir uns auf und rennen in der Stadt rum, um irgendwelche Leute zu belauschen, die auch nichts Neues zu sagen haben. Alles, was die tun, ist zu best\u00e4tigen, was wir bereits wissen, aber aus irgendeinem Grund unternehmen die Phantom Thieves nichts, wenn man ihnen die L\u00f6sung nicht in Gro\u00dfbuchstaben auf die Nase schreibt. Der Anf\u00fchrer und mein Chef, Joker, ist da auch weniger hilfreich, denn er hat nur eine Kunst gemeistert: Er ist gro\u00dfartig darin, drei Mal dasselbe in verschiedenen Worten zu sagen. Warum wir ihn immer wieder fragen, wissen wir auch nicht so genau.\n\nBis zum Abend sind wir in der Stadt rumgerannt und haben nicht wirklich etwas in Erfahrung bringen k\u00f6nnen, aber alle sind der Meinung, dass das, was wir wissen, ausreicht, um das Gef\u00e4ngnis einer Person zu betreten, die, wie die Bande vermutet, der B\u00f6sewicht ist. Das k\u00f6nnte ich denen auch so sagen, aber ich bin nur der Praktikant und mir h\u00f6rt keiner zu. Die Leute, die uns \u00fcber den Weg laufen und sich definitiv als Schurken entpuppen, sind n\u00e4mlich ziemlich eindeutig Fieslinge, was man schon an ihren Outfits erkennt, denn die haben irgendwann angefangen, ihre Klamotten zu designen und nicht wieder damit aufgeh\u00f6rt.\n\"Wir haben alles, was wir brauchen\", sagt Yusuke und haut auf den Tisch. \"Jetzt gibt es nur noch eins zu tun.\"\nIch freue mich bereits und hole die Waffen der Gang aus dem Schrank, als Yusuke die Hand hebt und eine beschwichtigende Geste macht.\n\"Nicht so flott, Spring-ins-Feld.\" Oh nein. \"Zuerst m\u00fcssen wir stundenlang \u00fcber unsere absolut unn\u00fctzen Informationen sprechen, dann ist noch ein Fest, auf das wir wollen, und da hinten hat eine Fressbude aufgemacht, die wir noch nicht ausprobiert haben. Au\u00dferdem gibt es hier mehrere Fanservice-Stationen, die wir aufsuchen m\u00fcssen.\"\nIch sinke auf meinen Stuhl und seufze ergeben. Bevor ich mich versehe, redet die Bande wieder \u00fcber die vergangene Zeit und tut so, als h\u00e4tten sie sich drei\u00dfig Jahre lang nicht gesehen, obwohl es nur sechs Monate waren. Bis das hier mal losgeht ...\n\n... vergehen noch einmal drei Stunden. Endlich fangen die Jugendlichen an, sich in aufwendig gestaltete Bondageoutfits zu werfen und ich muss zugeben, dass die Leutchen schon echt Stil haben, selbst wenn sie ewig brauchen, um in Gang zu kommen.\n\nVon da an geht alles ganz schnell: Wir springen in eine metaphorische Welt, die sich f\u00fcr cleverer h\u00e4lt, als sie eigentlich ist, und fangen an, wahllos irgendwelche Viecher zu verkloppen. Das reinste Chaos bricht aus, manchmal f\u00e4llt es mir schwer, den \u00dcberblick zu bewahren, doch ich habe recht schnell den Dreh raus und pr\u00fcgele mich fast so effektiv durch die Gegnerhorden, wie die etablierten Diebe. Dass dabei einiges an Komplexit\u00e4t fl\u00f6ten gegangen ist, interessiert mich nicht. Ich wollte mich mit Monstern keilen und genau das bekomme ich geboten, da brauche ich keine unn\u00f6tig komplizierten Mechaniken. Yusuke bleibt sich treu und labert die ganze Zeit, w\u00e4hrend ich versuche, mit den Monstern klar zu kommen. St\u00e4ndig klopft er mir auf die Schulter, unterbricht s\u00e4mtliches Geschehen und erkl\u00e4rt mir Kleinigkeiten, die ich schon wei\u00df. Das rei\u00dft mich aus dem Flow und ich bekomme von mehreren Monstern eins auf die M\u00fctze, da diese nicht damit geizen, Fertigkeiten einzusetzen - es ist recht kompliziert, alles und jeden kommen zu sehen, da brauche ich diese st\u00e4ndigen Unterbrechungen dieser Quasselstrippe nicht. Gl\u00fccklicherweise sind bei seinem Geplapper auch Informationen dabei, die mir etwas bringen: So verr\u00e4t er mir, dass mir Futaba \u00fcber ein Interface die Schw\u00e4chen der Gegner anzeigen l\u00e4sst, damit ich gezielt meine Personas verwenden kann, um sie mit den richtigen Fertigkeiten zu immobilisieren. Die Clique hat gelernt, mit den teilweise echt sinnlosen Schw\u00e4chen der Feinde umzugehen.\n\nWenn es nur immer so weiterwuchten w\u00fcrde, w\u00e4re ich gl\u00fccklich, aber leider bleibt die Phantomgruppe die Phantomgruppe. Es dauert nicht lang, bis ihnen der Schwei\u00df auf der Stirn steht und ihre M\u00fcnder sich bewegen. Mit gr\u00f6\u00dfter M\u00fche versuchen sie, eine Dialogflut zur\u00fcckzuhalten, aber es gelingt ihnen nicht. Mitten auf dem Schlachtfeld m\u00fcssen wir abbrechen, um in den Van zur\u00fcckzukehren, damit wir wieder \u00fcber Zeug labern k\u00f6nnen, dass ein Blinder mit Kr\u00fcckstock herausgefunden h\u00e4tte. Ich habe inzwischen das Gef\u00fchl, dass sich meine jungen Chefs sehr gern selber reden h\u00f6ren. V\u00f6llig zu recht, wie ich finde - das gro\u00dfe Ganze ist jetzt nicht unbedingt so berauschend und spannend, aber es fasziniert mich und ich mag die Clique, die den ganzen Karren mit ihrem Charme ziehen. Es f\u00fchlt sich zwar so an, als w\u00e4re ich einer Anime-OVA gefangen, aber ich dr\u00fccke mal beide Augen ganz kr\u00e4ftig zu.\n\nWenn ich mir am Ende meines Praktikums eins w\u00fcnschen d\u00fcrfte, dann w\u00e4re es, dass eine bessere Balance zwischen Gelaber und Gekloppe gefunden wird, aber sonst habe ich wenig zu beanstanden.\n\n****\n\nPersona 5 Strikers macht mir pers\u00f6nlich gro\u00dfen Spa\u00df. Klar hat es seine Schw\u00e4chen, aber die b\u00fcgeln die St\u00e4rken mit einem gro\u00dfen Eisen wieder glatt. Man wollte das Persona-Feeling einfangen und das ist gegl\u00fcckt, auch wenn die Dialogwahlm\u00f6glichkeiten ordentlich in die Hose gegangen sind und es offensichtlich ist, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2470393507]dass man drei Mal dasselbe sagt und es ein wenig anders formuliert[/url]. Ich mag es auch nicht sonderlich, dass meine Freiheit st\u00e4ndig eingeschr\u00e4nkt wird - wenn das Spiel will, dass gelabert wird, wird gelabert. Dann haben alle L\u00e4den zu und Seitenaktivit\u00e4ten m\u00fcssen warten. Mir f\u00e4llt ebenfalls auf, dass der Entwickler \u00fcber die Phantom Thieves zu den Spielern spricht, a la \"Hier guck mal, wir haben uns so lange nicht gesehen und da, kennst das da noch?\" und das ist arg Meta.\n\nDas Gameplay wurde auf ein Minimum reduziert und erinnert eher an Dynasty Warriors, aber selbst das ist es nicht. Die Gegner latschen auf einer Map herum, entweder \u00fcberfallen wir sie oder rennen direkt rein. Danach spawnen ein paar Typen, wir klatschen die auf und weiter gehts. Es gibt eine Levelup- und Bindungsmechanik, aber die erledigt sich zum gro\u00dfen Teil von selbst. Viel Einwirkung habe ich als Spieler nicht drauf.\n\nDas ergibt am Ende eine seichte Actionklopperei, die von ihrem Namen und den Figuren lebt. W\u00e4ren die Charaktere nicht so interessant, h\u00e4tte mich das Spiel l\u00e4ngst verloren - aber so will ich wissen, wie es f\u00fcr die Bande weitergeht, wohin es mich noch verschl\u00e4gt und worauf die ganze Sache am Ende hinauslaufen soll, denn - ohne jetzt was \u00fcber den Plot zu verraten - so richtig Sinn ergibt die Sache f\u00fcr mich aktuell noch nicht.\n\nWer Persona-Fan ist, kann hier bedenkenlos zuschlagen - alle anderen sollten sich unbedingt ein Video dr\u00fcber ansehen und eine Zusammenfassung \u00fcber den Plot von Persona 5 lesen, denn ohne Vorwissen ist man hier komplett verloren. Das Spiel richtet sich an Fans und wer als Nichtkenner dazu kommt, muss damit klar kommen, dass er nicht wei\u00df, wor\u00fcber die Leute da reden, wer das \u00fcberhaupt ist, was die machen und wieso \u00fcberhaupt und H\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4 im Allgemeinen.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0769451092125ee5b93f2be7ee4955f7", "author": "6ef29208a69b56f2aee85da3aaf07d2d", "date": "2021-05-06", "hours": 6170, "content": "The FPS in some parts of the game drops significantly for no reason.

addition to the Persona franchise, it blends Musou combat with Turn based gameplay really well.

There quality voice acting and plenty of dialogue (corny at times, but that's just how it is - and I love it). The musou-style of combat was pretty nice and felt a bit more complex than other musou-style games I've played as there are a few systems to master. Understanding these systems will be the key to your success: Character swapping, one more's, dodging, weaknesses, and technical attacks will all need to be understood to really feel like you're in control and not bashing your head against a wall feeling like you're not doing any damage.\n\nI definitely recommend this and had a great time playing.

I will fully admit that I am biased toward this series and ATLUS in general. So instead of listing reasons you should get this game I will do a Pro/Con/Depends list.\n\nPros: \n- Killer Soundtrack\n- Fun Hack & Slash Gameplay\n- Good Variety of Characters and Playstyles\n- Persona fusing has been changed. It now shows specific recipes for personas, even personas you don't yet own.   \n\nCons:\n- Combat/Combos/Abilities take time to learn and you will be going back to the tutorial menu when you forget which combo casts Zio. \n- No Igor or Akechi :(\n- I'll admit I'm struggling with coming up with cons, but I recommend looking at my next list to see if this game is right for you.\n\nDepends:\n- Direct sequel to Persona 5. This leaves a nice place for players to return to, but could alienate new players. It is worth mentioning that I tried my best to notice when the game made reference to the original P5 and it wasn't super frequent.\n- Shorter than most RPGs. My first run was ~55  hours. Keep in mind I did every side quest I could.\n\nHopefully this encouraged you to get the game. Overall, very fun hack and slash game that I had a hell of a time with. Don't go in looking for something super groundbreaking. Instead go in for a fun, flashy and fantastical game where a bunch of kids go on a road trip.

Not really. Is it a good action game with light rpg elements? It is, but it caters to specific audience. More below.\n\nLong story short, I have played this game for a while and got bored after second dungeon. I will try to explain what I liked what I didn't like.\n\n1. What I liked:\n\n-The storyline, the characters and the plot are still good. It's one of the most enjoyable aspects. Of course, you no longer need to grind out stats and there are no new romancable characters, your choices barely matter too, if at all. But, it's good for what it is.\n-I enjoyed the music, although Royal stuck in my ears more.\n-The action can be meaty and fun, but as you progress through the game, it can get repetitive, since it's all about striking weakness, all out attacks and murdering hordes of shadows. \n-I commend being able to translate persona 5 and persona 5 royal combat into action. It works well.\n-It is very skill based, what it means is that if you learn a pattern of a boss, you can solo one yourself, similar to Hollow Knight or Devil May Cry.\n\n2. What I didn't like:\n-The new dungeons are ... well, a bit meh. Exploration is honestly tiresome and unlike Persona 5, getting around without fighting is not easy. It's not rewarding either. The items barely matter, same with most personas. \n-Being able to come and go into the Dungeon with 0 consequences. I mean, I get the idea, but it only makes the game feel more shallow. It is necessary evil though, as you burn through most of your SP easily.\n-Fusing new personas is not fun or rewarding. Most of the time all you need is being able to get a weakness of every enemy. The only exception to that is when you are alone and the enemy strikes your weakness. Healing is better done through allies.\n-Bosses are wayyyyy too tanky, as far as I am concerned. I mean, Persona 5 Royal bosses were tough, but fun for the most part (obligatory horrible Okumara's boss fight). They required more strategy than whacking a boss for 20 minutes and dodging their attacks or healing.\n-There is no time management. All the dungeons are done in one day and the story won't progress if you don't do them that very day. It maybe fun for some, but not for me.\n\nSo, I am not sure how to rate this game. For those who liked Persona 5 for it's rpg elements, plot, characters, they may not enjoy the action focused style. On the other hand, if you like that kind of thing, like dynasty warriors, you will probably enjoy it.\n\nBecause of that, I give it two marks, depending on what you are looking for:\n\na) 6+/10 for those looking for something more meaningful than pure combat.\nb) 8+/10 for those who like this kind of thing. \n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8645bddfc6af5b48ab7eeea4c1a7ec8c", "author": "b987c4e288b9547eaaa117178eea80df", "date": "2021-05-01", "hours": 3318, "content": "It's Showtime!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "53cd4e1ef8705acebefa02d628935dc1", "author": "a75119c03f4a573d8e28146ecc0e7682", "date": "2021-05-01", "hours": 9200, "content": "I bought it again despite already having it on Switch thanks to the sale, and I must admit the 60FPS my gaming laptop can muster makes the game feel suprisingly different in a good way!\n\nThe game already means a lot to me as the whole setting and idea pretty much broke the chains I had been bound upon in my head by myself during the ongoing pandemic. It even learned me how to control my subconcious mind better along the way.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. Makes good use of the Persona system and translates it to real-time combat rather than turn-based and even the music remixes are made to complement the change perfectly well! It also just plays a lot better than most Warriors games, with more focus on story to balance out the often repetitive gameplay of these kinda games. It builds more upon a world and its exploration, rather than the 'Select a battle' style most Warriors games have nowadays.\n\nWant a game that can hit you in the feels, and have a amazing soundtrack to go with it along with many other things to love in a RPG, then give this game a go for sure. Switch, Steam, both are good in their own ways.\n\nOh, and finally: Persona 3 (FES), Persona 5 Royal or just the whole Persona series for Switch and Steam when? I'm not asking this like many others are at every single chance to do so, this is even my first time doing it like this. Persona as a series, despite having watched more playthroughs than actually having played it, still really helped me understand myself more as the games show the way people work very well. Persona 4 touches upon acceptance of yourself and your bad sides, Persona 5 Strikers then goes deeper into that idea and instead goes for the way people become due to traumas or other events they might've gone through in the past and can't let go off.\n\nSo another point: If you feel you're struggling with these things, give the series a go (Or a look) and don't take everything at face value. The games have a weird way of showing off the Human mind, but it's actually not all that far-fetched if you really think about.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d09354bc52df5597b998c75df74cfe52", "author": "60ebae3d0f3259a0ab66757b6e0cd941", "date": "2021-05-01", "hours": 2046, "content": "\u4e0d\u9519", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e9ae2f4d67b1587099aedf0dd5a85cf4", "author": "3d5d51c0be095f6ea5eac1a1d7ec2950", "date": "2021-05-01", "hours": 4155, "content": "If you want more Persona 5, it's a nice addition.

Imagine hyrule warriors but every enemy has elemental strengths and weaknesses, and you can collect enemies like pokemon and fuze them into different, stronger fighters (called personas). There's also basic enviromental attacks that do elemental damage. Add switching between characters as well, and the result is good fun. There's an additional amount of depth in technicals, ailments, buffs/debuffs, but you don't really need to focus on them, even in hard mode. \n\nThe problem is that it, like other warrior esc games, it gets repetitive. Boss battles are supposed to freshen it up, but they mostly fight like other enemies but with quicker attacks and bigger health bars. So, you're gonna do a lot of swinging, casting a spell at a weakness, and dodging regardless of the fight, and not much else. It really would benefit with much more emphasis on inflicting technicals/ailments and switching to different personas/party members to deal damage. Then each fight requires using your brain a bit instead of how it currently is. \n\nUnlike persona 5, there's not much side stuff to do, so there isn't really much to take a break from the combat. Side quests boil down to doing combat challenges, fetching items for party members, or both. A lot of them require you backtrack through previous dungeons too. This game is really only playable for the main story.\n\nIt's still fun and I enjoy it, can't see it being worth $60 though.

Some better than others but overall yes.\n\nNow onto the actual spoiler-free Review.\nWhile it is different from the Turn-Based battles of the series, it's still a very good game. As I have played some hack and slash games, While I may be a bit biased on this decision, Persona 5 Strikers is my favorite of that genera due to the characters, story, and overall feeling of the fighting. Its nice to have different abilities and still have it feeling like the main series. I still highly recommend playing P5/R before playing P5S if you can.\nThe controls are easy to understand. I personally played with a controller as thats what I use for hack and slash and persona games in general. (Xbox One and Switch Pro Controller for more background) While I dont think its impossible to play with a keyboard and mouse, it would be harder as you only have 8 ways to move. But play how you want to or have the ability to play with.\nOverall, Recommended. With a few aceptions.

I really enjoyed traveling around Japan with the Phantom Thieves. The story is shorter than P5R's, but can still last a good 50-60 hours if you plan to do everything. \n\n- Of course, the music is perfect, as always with anything Persona. The music has shifted towards a rock theme instead of jazz, and it works perfectly. The entire OST is incredible and gets stuck in your head for weeks after you finish. We've also been blessed with several new vocal tracks from Lyn.\n\n- I highly recommend this game to anyone who played and loved the original Persona 5.

Getting the bonus BGM from the deluxe edition helped with fights to add more variety too but that is more money to be spent.\n\nI did not have any crashing problems as I played like other people seem to have had, the most recent patch might have fixed that. Some of the CG cut scenes in the beginning had some crusty frame rate but towards the end I noticed it got better. Gameplay was smooth the entire time. \n\nI paid $76 USD for the deluxe edition. I felt like it was worth it for myself, as I am becoming increasingly invested in the persona games. If you're just a casual fan that is not super invested then maybe getting it at $40 or $50 might feel better for you.\n\nIt is a direct sequel to Persona 5 though, so you might want to play that beforehand.

Don't let the Musou battle system scare you away. This battle system is miles better than anything Dynasty Warriors has done since its creation.\n\n+ The Battle system is fun and skillful. Each character has abilities to learn and unlock and a specific playstyle. Each playstyle can be extremely useful or largely abused (against you) depending on which and what type of enemy you are fighting\n+ Tons and tons of Personas for our Protagonist, just like in P5/P5R\n+ Throbbing King of Desire returns. If you're not sure about this reference, avoid looking it up in public\n+ Great story. Great Characters. Same feeling and writing style from P5/P5R\n+ Same great music\n+ Post game content\n+ Returning entity from P3 (don't look it up)\n\n- Save Often. Crashes from time to time/infinite loading screens. I think the 1.02 patch fixed most of this (at the time of posting this review 4/27/21) as I was having much less crashing upon it's implementation, but not entirely resolved.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74c7f40f516b5a3c8f571eaa9e43fdcb", "author": "b123c24d91ba5bea9e8e1f1942ee42aa", "date": "2021-04-28", "hours": 6396, "content": "RECOMENDADO 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fc347a1d883f551e9c9e42bfd39ff80b", "author": "be384140b5df5cac984153a9530f5b43", "date": "2021-04-27", "hours": 1262, "content": "gud", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e421894cdd305fecb39fb3bf73fb9e78", "author": "1b6fa8764062529594f91c5e131e23c6", "date": "2021-04-27", "hours": 2852, "content": "\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u280b\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2881\u2808\u28bb\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u2840\u282d\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2880\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u2836\u2819\u28ff\u285f\u2821\u28f4\u28ff\u28fd\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28df\u28ed\u28fe\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u28f4\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u2884\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u28e9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u284f\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f9\u284b\u2818\u2837\u28e6\u28c0\u28e0\u2876\u2801\u2808\u2801\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cd\u2803\u28f4\u28f6\u2854\u2812\u2804\u28e0\u2880\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2868\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2858\u283f\u28f7\u28ff\u283f\u281f\u2803\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u2847\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2881\u28f7\u28e0\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28c0\u28e0\u28fe\u285f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2809\u2819\u283b\n\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u286f\u2893\u28f4\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u285f\u28f7\u2804\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 10, "funny": 6, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9d149073710455a9b440bb9e5bc290e4", "author": "badc1cb07d795a2383c51a4a02d191ed", "date": "2021-04-27", "hours": 3767, "content": "Persona 5 Royal on Steam, Now.

The game is still split in 2 sections, the Metaverse and the  real world. \n\nThe gameplay in the Metaverse is mostly the same as Persona 5's, except for the combat. You'll navigate around, hide in corners and ambushing enemies the same, but instead of turn-based combat it's a Dynasty Warriors style. The fights don't span the entire map like other entries in the genre, but are instead in small, restricted areas. Most of the Persona fight aspects are still there, using Personas to attack, taking advantage of elements, all out attacks, and the like. Ambushes against weaker enemies usually ends up with an immediate All-Out-Attack and winning immediately, though tougher fights do take more time as expected. While fighting, you have 3 teammates with you, which you can control both in fights and while exploring the dungeons. Each teammate has a unique playstyle too.\n\nIn the real world, things are very dialed back compared to the full Persona games. There are no Confidants/Social Links, and most of the confidants from 5 are gone, but not unmentioned. There are no romance options, either. There's no stats to build. There's no time limit on completing the dungeons, you are free to leave and re-enter them as much as you want as opposed to progressing to the next day as is usual. Most of your time in the real world is spent either shopping for items, completing tasks for rewards like new weapons, or just doing story-related tasks such as getting info on the next dungeon boss.\n\nThe story itself I have not completed, but from what I have played it is very enjoyable. The game is very much a sequel to Persona 5, the original version, not Royal. It's nice to come back to the Phantom Thieves.\n\nOverall, while the Metaverse side is quite fun and familiar, the real world side feels lacking and leaves me wanting more. However, I'd still recommend this game. It's still a fun game and the team is as enjoyable as ever, but playing the game makes me want to revisit Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "18ded86b92d654b3976c90338f5b423f", "author": "7f710c62f0805c90afca90409a7d321b", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 2508, "content": "BRING P5 ROYAL ON STEAM !!!!!!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 67, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4c428ed5c0a85996bca8025cba9fc454", "author": "cae24cb248cc56a9bb18a00a81ac29e0", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 1685, "content": "Very fun to play.

Go into Metaverse and change the hearts of villains. However, there are a few twists and turns regarding it this time around that significantly change how it feels, but I will not spoil the specifics.\nIn terms of gameplay, well, this is an action game, not a turn-based RPG. Despite that, it's an excellent translation of traditional Persona gameplay into this new genre. However, you need to be ready to actually rely on melee attacks and items instead of just spamming spells this time around, because the game will drain your SP like there's no tomorrow otherwise.\nAs far as social links are concerned, well, there are none. This is understandable, since you are supposed to already know the characters well enough for this not to be necessary.

Ils retrouvent donc toute la troupe des voleurs fant\u00f4me pour passer des vacances d'\u00e9t\u00e9 qui bien-sur, se verra interrompu par de nouveaux environnements ( ben oui Atlus nous pond pas un jeu pour ce gratter les boules sur la plage et bouffer des glaces xD ). De nouveaux cas de m\u00e9tanoia font apparition et les voleur fant\u00f4me sont sous les feu des projecteurs. Vous allez devoir enqu\u00eater sur qui tire les ficelles. \n\nGRAPHISME:\n+ Franchement c'est pas ouf ( c'est d\u00e9gueulasse ) mais la direction artistique est toujours aussi magique ( les graphisme ne \n   fait pas un jeu ). \n- Cela dit il y'a pas mal d'aliasing m\u00eame quand vous mettez l'option aliasing \" ON \"\n\nBANDE SON:\n+ une \u00e9rection l\u00e9gendaire !!!! ( j'aime beaucoup le cot\u00e9 jazzy ) surtout que des morceaux originaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remak\u00e9 \u00e0 la \n   sauce guitare \u00e9lectrique.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n+ Comme dans un jeu MUSO, vous faites des combos \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9s qu'il faudra prendre en compte la faiblesse des \n   ennemie comme dans le jeu de base en changeant de persona qui se fait de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s fluide !\n- Le bouton d'action Y ( je joue avec une manette xbox ) est sollicit\u00e9 pour beaucoup de chose et peut vous faire effectuer \n   des actions dont vous ne vouliez peut \u00eatre pas ! ( je sais pas si c'est fran\u00e7ais ce que je viens d'\u00e9crire ).\n\nConclusion:\nDe mon avis personnel, il manque un petit quelque chose que Persona 5 avait mais bon.\nFan de PERSONA FONCEZ !!! sinon pour les autres personnes qui ne connaisse pas trop, je vous conseille de faire Persona 5 avant tout car le jeu est assez bavard ( un JRPG quoi ) et ne plaira pas \u00e0 tout le monde \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il est assez sp\u00e9cial.\n\nSi vous voulez un format vid\u00e9o la voici : https://youtu.be/ZrAn_Hj7DP0\n\nMerci de m'avoir lu !", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "56faac8cda435c2eb1bfe9e4389e3633", "author": "8a61c07756ae5804ab366631edcf7225", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 4486, "content": "It's a perfect sequel to Persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7a387f89815351aa9eca91a9d8155620", "author": "33f03c897c945a49ac540db4b6e9668d", "date": "2021-04-25", "hours": 4915, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers it's a really great game but you definitely need to play Persona 5 Vanilla/Royal for better understanding.

It's Persona alright, but they took out the turn-based nature and the multiple different endings, and kept everything else.

Empty and uncompelling- there's nothing to search for unless you want some cards or sellable junk. If something spots you, you're forced into a battle unless you run away fast enough, and it's always a group of enemies that you'll Yakuza-fight away with whichever character you've chosen to play as.\n\nHere's the bad thing, though. It's a hard game unless you set it to easy. Why? Literally in the first Jail, you'll find out that the characters are all squishy as hell and get afflicted with status effects constantly. It's extremely annoying, and they'll all usually die while you're trying to take something down. It made me realize that the turn-based system is REALLY needed if you have all these systems in play, cause otherwise you get this game where everyone gets randomly spammed with whatever until they die.

I wouldn't know if how much of my criticisms have changed. I think that this game is pretty neat, I wouldn't have had put as many hours as i have put into it if I didn't enjoy it. \n\nParts of the game could have been better, though a lot of my criticisms have been already addressed by a lot of people though I'll say that how leaving the dungeon and coming back to restore hp and more importantly sp is kinda dumb that it just doesn't heal automatically, I guess its to have the feeling of during new game plus or whatever the player can feel like they didn't need to come back and rejuvenate but doesn't really feel like its needed aside from possibly needing to stock up on items which could just be done anyways.\n\nThe story is fine I liked parts of it can't say I'm too much of a fan though even if it is just mostly dumb fun, I like some of the new characters but that's about it. \n\nThe game would crash on me a unusual amount of times for almost no explainable reason, I detected a pattern some of the time with like traveling between the velvet room and back or like leaving the game on in the background for a realllllly long time and then it would crash after some transition back to the real world, but other times i really couldn't explain why like during story events, so I just got used to save somewhat often since it barely takes that much time.\n\nI got a unusual amount of time trying to assemble some heavy hitting personas (even if lucifer is just the best for dealing with large groups) and figuring out a lot of the different combos that come with those personas and even different party members, its all built pretty well. In the case of joker though being able to switch out to a persona that nulls or absorbs a attack was pretty satisfying though it also kinda feels like there's not really a reason not to freeze time to null a attack instead of like dodging or something, due to how most attacks don't really move when you freeze time and select a different persona, aside from some attacks acting during that time but barely ever happens. I think if a sequel or a different SMT spin off as there could be a lot to expand on here gameplay wise. \n\nIf you like this series there's not really a reason to not get the game but just gonna say I'd wait for a discount because despite all the good I don't think its worth 60 bucks, and I especially don't think it was worth 70 bucks even if I got to access it 3 days early and some music dlc/extras which in all honesty ain't much : P (Or you could just buy it anyways). ~~I'm sure I'll complain about the price of things more as soon as nocturne hd comes out~~", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "75d2ab4cf0d3596d960c4cf8382287de", "author": "960a0428eb985db6a49f6be62e7c7d75", "date": "2021-04-23", "hours": 2668, "content": "Makoto Niijima", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e1750e67bb8f595f8fe83867fcb85a85", "author": "8583efc4bae15de6b7c4521fdf7431f5", "date": "2021-04-22", "hours": 2697, "content": "yes", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d77f453ae1ae5300b0cf342b73809a6e", "author": "601ad704d1515b47b976662eb99fa221", "date": "2021-04-22", "hours": 534, "content": "I got to first boss.

Those big brawls are there, but most mob fights are far more similar to a traditional persona confrontation, against a handful (around 10) enemies with different weaknesses, and we could always pause the action by holding down the right bumper, so it's a real-time with pause action game.\n\nEverything takes place within the summer holidays, so Strikers is shorter in both story and character development, but the main cast is as likable as ever. The timeline is a direct continuation from the original P5, but it's somewhat jarring that the other characters seem to have forgotten their relationship (if any) with Joker. Also, considering that the Phantom Thieves are already embedded in the public consciousness and they're stirring up quite a storm this time, it's awkward to not hear a single peep from their outer circle of confidants. The Mishima we know would have gone ballistic from the stuff they're doing this time around.\n\nGameplay-wise, party members mostly reprise their original roles in P5. For example, Skull is still a powerhouse in boss fights; he's actually better than Joker until Joker's personas are fully developed. Mona is still a reliable wind hitter / heal battery, and he can transform into his van form to road rage into enemies again and again. Fox's playstyle centers around countering single physical hits with his own, and a few members can imbue their normal hits with their native element, bypassing physical resistance or immunity. Ammo fully regenerates after every fight. Noir (when mastered) can shoot for free, and certain members have ways to replenish mid-fight.\n\nThis time around, the Personas and fusion system are a bit more interesting. Having come from the original P3 and P4, it was far too easy in P5 (and P4G) to put any skill into any persona, rendering the nuance in inheritance slot limitations, elemental restrictions, and multiple fusions completely moot. I'm pretty sure everyone's glad that random inheritance is gone, but P5's system made it such that personas without unique skills are only as good as their innate resistances or growth potential i.e. the lower their initial level, the better, so many personas that start at high level, e.g. Messiah and many arcana capstones, are no good. It made no sense.\n\nIn this game, there are no personas locked behind DLC, and on top of the 8 skill slots, each persona has up to 3 combo skills that cost no SP or HP. These are innate to each persona, and they restore personas' much-needed identity. For example, want to combo into a free maziodyne? Thor is our only pick. Mara has its own unique combo-only severe fire skill called maralagidyne. Skill cards are still there, but they cannot modify these combo skills, and the best ones only drop at the very end of the post-game of NG+, so if we want good personas earlier on, especially when just going into Risky / Merciless difficulty, fusion is the way to go. There's also no limit on persona stat growth, so if we have the resources, there's no problem enhancing all stats to 99.\n\nDefense passives such as absorb element that are traditionally extremely powerful in turn-based persona, are not very relevant here, because we could just switch to another persona at any time. Enemy moves are clearly telegraphed, and baton pass, showtime, as well as all-out attacks all confer generous iframes, on top of dodge roll. That's before factoring in the omnipotent orb. It's a very interesting change-up in terms of how an end-game persona is supposed to look like.\n\nThere's also surprisingly little grind in this game, which is really welcome. I'm sitting at 100% completion with about 100 hours on my file from just playing through normally, and Joker's personas and four other members are already all maxed out. If you want to max everyone's stats with incenses, that will take a few hours fighting the reaper on Merciless difficulty (he drops 75 incenses in one go). Or if you absolutely need some skill card, e.g. any drain card. For that, good luck, because some of the drop rates are really, really low.\n\nAs for things that could be improved, a persona's combo moves aren't shown in the compendium, so the only way to know is to try them out or look them up. Analog movement is also really iffy even when using a controller; your character is locked into 8 directions of movement. It's bad when moving around, but surprisingly enough, it doesn't get in the way during fights.\n\nAs a separate issue, once Joker's personas get powerful enough, it becomes possible to just endlessly stunlock most bosses by inflicting burn, freeze, or shock, and then literally just doing hassou tobi / vacuum wave over and over with knockdown style and technical adept. That's... a really boring way to play the game, but it's also the fastest way to bring down the boss. That's no good.\n\nHere's to a simultaneous PC release for P6, eh Atlus? Maybe include a difficulty option to disable skill cards for fusion purists.\n\nA few tips for Risky / Merciless difficulty: Start with at least a good persona or two, e.g. Yoshi, and max Navi's HP first, for the defense sections. The best way to spawn treasure demons for money and skill cards is to just move around or change zones when alert level is in the red, after clearing at least one group. They have a distinctive way of scooting around the minimap, and they give off a continuous tinkle even when not in line of sight. In the final dungeon, treasure demons give 750k yen with the money accessory, and you should be able to get one to spawn every 5 minutes or less. Dire shadows are best for bond points. For PP, just keep enhancing and dismissing the same persona over and over.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't miss this if you're a persona fan.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2bee5a4eabde57eaa3869eaed802328f", "author": "9e487c8e9dd35520b408cd3b38004e8a", "date": "2021-04-22", "hours": 5711, "content": "Persona 5 oyununun devam\u0131 niteli\u011finde yap\u0131lm\u0131\u015f harika bir oyun.

They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it. Because you get through \"jail\"(which is the P5:Striker's Palaces) is so much easier than palaces in the OG Persona. The fighting is also pretty sick.

In short, this game is fun as hell.  Now for the long part.  The combat is fast paced and has interesting mechanics to boot.  You would think that pausing the game in order to select a skill from a menu would be detrimental to the pace of battle, but it actually isn't. Furthermore, every member of the Phantom Thieves has their own unique playstyle, which kind of implies that each PT member has their own situational usage.  Joker has his usual \"wild card\" sitch, Ryuji is the heavy, Morgana becomes a car, Ann has an enchant, Yusuke is a Fire emblem character, you can finally ride Makoto's bike, Haru is a beyblade, and the two new characters each have their own thing going on too.  Sophia is a great addition to the PT, acting as kind of a Morgana 2.0 from P5, (she navigates the PT to and through the Jails, which are like Palaces from P5, so no Sophia means no game) considering she's an amnesiac who has no clue what her origin is.  However, instead of being quite annoying like our favorite mascot, Sophia ends up being one of the most likable characters in the whole game.  Then there's Zenkichi, who's basically Dojima from P4 [spoiler] but he's a Persona user [/spoiler].  He is also an amazing addition to the PT, acting as a kind of \"team dad,\" who looks out for and genuinely cares about his team, his family, and justice.  The villains in this game are also pretty great.  Instead of being one-dimensional hate sinks like in P5 (not R), these guys have more depth to their actions, usually acting the way they are due to trauma and abuse from earlier points in their lives.  Main bad guy is kind of a toss up though, since I still think Shido had so much going on in P5 that it's really hard to even come close to him, and [spoiler] Konoe [/spoiler] felt less diabolical once you learn his backstory.  Overall, I think this game is great, but I did have some issues with fullscreen and had a few crashes.

That said, it's defiantly still a Persona game, which is good. Weakness and Technical attacks are the biggest key to actually getting anything done so it's not just mindlessly spamming the same combo every which way the wind blows. Technical hits in particular are vastly more important then in P5/Royal since you can Ailment bosses and especially trigger Technical hits that will chip away at enemy shields (which is necessary for the few enemies with no Weaknesses).\n\nI would only recommend people interested to hold off if they haven't played P5/Royal since it is a sequel.

Fast paced gameplay, all of the Phantom Thieves being playable, amazing visuals and music as always, jails being open world. This game has a lot to offer and, to me, it cuts out a ton of the fat that mainline Persona games have. Practically cutting playtime by half at MAXIMUM. \n\nThis game's main strengths are its gameplay and its bosses. The quick battles and moves you can pull off are really fun. And while the bosses in base P5 were memorable, they didn't have terribly much depth (aside from a few exceptions and Royal). In Strikers, there's a little more to each of the Jail Rulers and I love that. Also, [spoiler]Konoe has the best boss fight and music in the game. I played that fight like four different times. It's amazing.[/spoiler]\n\nI do think the game starts to lose so much steam towards the end (which I think is the inverse problem that P5R had) and the amount of work you need to do to get all the perks is insane. But overall, highly recommend this game to people who loved Persona 5 and the characters, but also don't feel like putting in the insane amount of time into another playthrough.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dbc22ad4e50a5b879eb4c3f26ecefa55", "author": "d772d3cdfe605016ad6e342261e9196e", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 200, "content": "perpona 5 strikers", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "12a15e8cf12758dfa2ad8f1b7b2a7d44", "author": "d1fe0a4bbc8d5ecdb3dec021fe363a30", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 4674, "content": "the game crashes A LOT. its 51 hours for me and im pretty much at the end of the game but the amount of time ive actually played is 41 or so ive lost so much time grinding to only have the game crash. pretty frustrating IMO. its  a good game but make sure to save anytime you get the chance", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "566051141ea35d17a3999afbf7cf51de", "author": "5b083fb2ac655fb99a4da715f351792f", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 4040, "content": "I C H I N O S E \n11/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a63e71a4d53058e08d8cd1764359e938", "author": "4a714d82edb55eeca5c357032596e92a", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 367, "content": "a great sequel", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4bcd807b21305554bce3ee43f9fe90dc", "author": "fc4f876eb8b45049b466226a198d9de6", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 3933, "content": "I enjoyed the game, but it is not without flaws.\nTLDR: The game crashes, save frequently. Combat is fun but some fights can drag on too long. The plot is fine, nothing special but having the gang all together in new places has some great interactions. If you are a fan of the Phantom Thieves and can stomach the potential crashes and gameplay issues, get it. If you aren't invested in the characters, there isn't much reason to get this over other action games.\n\ncrashes - In the 60 hrs it took me to beat the game on normal and do all requests, the game crashed several times during loading screens. There are few things more frustrating than beating a tedious optional boss and then the game crashing when you leave the area.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, each story boss has a unique design and arena that makes their fight interesting. Mini-bosses not so much, they felt more like tedious resource drains. The optional bosses even more so, spamming skills to destroy their guard just to have your fully upgraded all-out-attack move the hp bar 10 pixels doesn't feel great.\n\nUnlike other musou games, melee kinda takes a back seat. The combination of melee doing small chip damage and 100 things flying around the battle, makes melee risky and unrewarding and persona skills far superior. Other than generic grunts, if you are approximately the same level as an enemy they don't especially care about any attacks that aren't the element they are weak against. Each character has a combo or 2 that deal their element as damage without using sp, but the real deal hits harder. You're gonna want to stock up on sp recovery for challenging fights.\n\nThere are some fun character interactions as the thieves interact with each other in new situations and environments. I also love the new characters. There is nothing from royal since the games were being made at the same time, so don't expect 3rd semester character growth to be present here.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "10205d80d83754379e1084c46efa1f50", "author": "72217c6c12ca545abac596c1ff5522d7", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 3549, "content": "yea it's pretty dope", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c575504691855fdca88474c24ff288ae", "author": "7267eeac8a3b541ca18dc04727ad8e67", "date": "2021-04-19", "hours": 3074, "content": "Yes.\n\nIt's more persona 5.

Too many times I've lost fights because my team didn't have the correct type matchups, or we burned through all our SP in a single strong enemy encounter.

Le meccaniche sono davvero ottime: sono pi\u00f9 debitrici a Persona che a Dinasty Warriors e richiedono una certa strategia con le debolezze e gli attacchi che gli altri giochi non hanno. Alcune ombre sono sfide impegnative e sono ben oltre il button-smashing. Riprendono technical, baton pass, weakness, necessit\u00e0 di buff&debuff mettendo tutto in tempo reale. \nQuesto \u00e8 un pro e un contro: io sono onestamente un gran fan del combattimento a turni, credo che possa regalare esperienze molto pi\u00f9 ragionate e quindi continuo a preferire i meccanismi tradizionali. Va detto che \u00e8 possibile \"freezare\" il tempo ogni volta che si invoca una Persona, cosa che aiuta a diminuire il livello di caos a cui un combattimento pu\u00f2 andare incontro. \nLe parti slice of life sono state molto rivedute e semplificate: non ci sono pi\u00f9 calendari serrati, visto che il tempo non trascorre fino a che la storia non lo richiede. I \"Confident\" sono inoltre al massimo (cosa sensata, visto che Strikers \u00e8 un sequel di Persona 5 e si suppone che tutti i Phantom Thieves siano gi\u00e0 mega bro), quello che si aumenta \u00e8 il loro legame collettivo, che d\u00e0 punti da spendere in varie abilit\u00e0. \nAnche le Personae sono meno e tutto sommato un pelo pi\u00f9 semplici da fondere. Finire il Registro non dovrebbe creare problemi enormi, almeno fino a dove sono arrivato (pi\u00f9 avanti della met\u00e0).\nInsomma, visto che i pregi sono tanti, vado ai difetti:\n\n- La trama \u00e8 interessante, ma ha dei momenti un po' meno esaltanti di altri. Inoltre anche se \u00e8 un gioco a s\u00e9, credo che giocarlo senza nemmeno conoscere la trama del 5 gli faccia perdere molto, ma molto appeal. Si percepisce che siamo nel seguito di una storia molto pi\u00f9 ampia. Inoltre \u00e8 una storia pi\u00f9 scanzonata e corale, manca un po' l'introspezione dei personaggi a cui la saga ci ha abituati. \n- il level design ha delle parti molto interessanti, ma mi \u00e8 parso complessivamente meno ispirato di Persona 5. Ma ci sta anche: l'esperienza centrale \u00e8 quella del fracassare orde di nemici, non dell'esplorazione del dungeon... per essere un musou \u00e8 pure fin troppo curato.  \n- A lungo andare c'\u00e8 un po' di ripetitivit\u00e0: ricerca di indizi, dungeon, torrioni da espugnare per prendere determinate chiavi scontro. Non che non ci siano alcune variazioni, ma non le ho trovate cos\u00ec significative. \n\nPer il resto... \u00e8 Persona 5: stilosissimo, musiche e art design fuori scala, accattivante pure nelle schermate del menu.

La plupart des m\u00e9caniques uniques aux jeux Persona, c'est \u00e0 dire: le Social Link et le cycle jour/\u00e9cole/soir ne sont pas pr\u00e9sent et le calendrier n'a pas du tout d'impact sur le gameplay. Donc, ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 avoir un jeu similaire \u00e0 Persona 5 en l'achetant.\n\n[b]Points positifs[/b]\n\nComme dit plus haut, le jeu n'a pas du tout les m\u00eames m\u00e9caniques qu'un jeu Persona, mais malgr\u00e9 \u00e7a, je trouve que l'univers et les personnages sont excellemment adapt\u00e9 au style de jeu de Persona 5 Strikers, \u00e0 aucun moment j'ai eu l'impression que quelque chose de tel ou tel Persona n'allait pas, au contraire. Chaque personnage \u00e0 son propre style de combat, ses propres atouts qui fait que chaque Voleur Fant\u00f4me \u00e0 son importance, contrairement au 5, ou l'on pouvait se passer de certains personnages.\n\nLe gameplay est tr\u00e8s plaisant, pouvoir d\u00e9foncer des centaines d'ombres en variant coups au corps \u00e0 corps et sorts de Personae, c'est vraiment agr\u00e9able et je pense que ce confort est d\u00fb aux contr\u00f4les qui sont tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 prendre en main.\n\nAutre point qui m'a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment fait plaisir: pouvoir jouer tous les Voleurs Fant\u00f4mes, par \u00e7a, je veux dire qu'il est possible de se balader dans les prisons (\u00e9quivalent des palais de Persona 5) avec n'importe qui, que ce soit Ryuji, Ann, Joker, etc... Mais ce n'est pas tout, vous pouvez \u00e9galement retourner dans les prisons que vous avez compl\u00e9t\u00e9s! Et \u00e7a, c'est vraiment super cool, car cela vous permet de compl\u00e9ter le compendium de Persona plus facilement et de mani\u00e8re plus amusante.\n\nPour conclure avec les points positifs, j'aimerais mettre en avant deux points: \n- la bande-son du jeu qui est tr\u00e8s fid\u00e8le au style du premier, avec quelques petits remix de certaines musiques m\u00e9morables du 5 qui passent vraiment bien avec le style du jeu.\n- le contenu annexe au jeu, par \u00e7a, j'entends les qu\u00eates secondaires, les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s des produits dans les magasins en fonction de la ville ou vous \u00eates, les mini-boss dans les prisons, etc...\n\n[b]Points n\u00e9gatifs[/b]\n\nBien que les contr\u00f4les soient assez basiques, les combos ne sont pas bien compliqu\u00e9s, je trouve que la prise en main du jeu au niveau du gameplay peut \u00eatre assez difficile pour quelqu'un qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit au style du jeu. En tout cas pour ma part, j'ai eu un peu de mal au d\u00e9but. \n\nCe point-l\u00e0 selon moi, cause un autre probl\u00e8me, la difficult\u00e9, je trouve que la difficult\u00e9 du jeu au tout d\u00e9but est assez haute et qu'une fois que l'on comprend le fonctionnement du jeu, le jeu devient plut\u00f4t facile. J'ai eu plus de mal \u00e0 battre le premier boss du jeu, que le dernier... Je pense qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux d'y aller doucement d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but pour que les joueurs puisse appr\u00e9hender le fonctionnement du jeu, puis augmenter la difficult\u00e9 petit \u00e0 petit. \n\nFini avec la partie technique, maintenant passons \u00e0 l'histoire et aux personnages. Dans l'ensemble l'histoire \u00e9tait int\u00e9ressante et plut\u00f4t agr\u00e9able \u00e0 suivre, mais je trouve qu'elle manque vraiment de d\u00e9tails. Il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'informations et de personnages qui auraient pu \u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s en profondeur pour ajouter du piment au jeu et rendre ce jeu aussi \u00e9pique que son ain\u00e9. \n\nUn autre point qui m'a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9rang\u00e9 et qui m'a fait d\u00e9crocher du jeu pendant 1 mois avant d'y revenir, c'est les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions dans la construction des Prisons au d\u00e9but du jeu. Pendant les 15 premi\u00e8res heures de jeu, le jeu est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9p\u00e9titif et l'histoire avance tr\u00e8s peu, on vous introduit a quelques personnages qui auront (ou non) de l'importance dans le jeu, mais c'est tout. \n\n----\n\n[i]A l'heure ou j'\u00e9cris cette review, j'ai eu pas mal de crash durant ma run, ce qui est assez probl\u00e9matique, surtout sur un jeu ou il n'y a pas de sauvegarde automatique, donc je vous conseille de sauvegarder r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement pour \u00e9viter de perdre des heures de jeu... Le probl\u00e8me sera tr\u00e8s certainement r\u00e9gl\u00e9 d'ici quelques semaines.[/i]\n\nJe pense que ce jeu est clairement une bonne suite \u00e0 Persona 5, ainsi qu'une tr\u00e8s bonne conclusion \u00e0 l'histoire des Voleurs Fant\u00f4mes (m\u00eame si la conclusion du 5 \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bien aussi) mais je pense que l'exp\u00e9rience aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 encore plus agr\u00e9able si l'histoire et le d\u00e9veloppement de personnage \u00e9taient plus approfondis.\n\nATLUS a tr\u00e8s certainement voulu surfer sur la hype de Joker et sa bande, on ne peut pas le nier, mais je respecte \u00e9norm\u00e9ment leur choix d'avoir conclut l'histoire des Voleurs Fant\u00f4mes sur un style de jeu qui est totalement in\u00e9dit dans la s\u00e9rie des jeux Persona.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8198fa4f47d35d60904cb1649cf764d9", "author": "503066c2984d5601bd2dc27fab920cbe", "date": "2021-04-14", "hours": 1959, "content": "sb\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0cr9 5900x + 3090\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u73a9\u7684\u597d\u597d\u5730\u7a81\u7136\u95ea\u9000\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7a81\u7136\u5361\u6b7b\uff0ccpu\u5360\u7528\u7387\u76f4\u63a5\u98d9\u5230100%\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c31\u662f\u65e0\u5c3d\u7684\u7b49\u5f85\uff0c\u597d\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u5361\u5b8c\u4e86\uff0c\u521a\u8d70\u4e24\u6b65\u53c8\u98d9\u5230100%\u3002\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u6cd5\u73a9", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4c5313660c3c5632a51b4dc0c117b762", "author": "c932e190719d54009baf2f243728391f", "date": "2021-04-14", "hours": 1457, "content": "Absolut eint\u00f6nige K\u00e4mpfe gegen Bosse mit l\u00e4cherlich viel Leben.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7b09792ecad95234944dbff123565443", "author": "c25889b21c8e53b99ae54eaf1735244e", "date": "2021-04-14", "hours": 1076, "content": "This might just be a computer issue, but the game crashes almost every time I try and boot it up or when theres a transition(i.e cutscenes, going to different locations, etc.)and its caused me to get stuck fighting the same battle over and over again even though I have already beaten it. Good thing the battles are crazy fun, swapping from a turn based to open world combat system is one of the best changes to the persona formula imo.

You can use any controller you can connect to Steam for this game but you need to launch the game with the controller already in use on the PC. I recommend launching the game from \"Big Picture\" mode. \n\nOne major issue (at the time of this review 4/13/21) is a crashing issue. My game has crashed when entering Jails (this game's version of a Palace) and during transition sequences within the Jails. So i HIGHLY recommend saving at EVERY possible chance you get or you will lose progress when it crashes.\n\nMusic is great, just like in every other Persona game. \n\nGameplay is obviously different but once you get used to it you will enjoy it, especially if you like games like Dynasty Warriors. Being able to play as any character in your party is a nice touch and having (almost) every beloved Phantom Thief unlocked right away is a good touch. Joker's Wild Card still lets you get Personas, but now instead of convincing them to join you they will instead sometimes drop masks when defeated.

I actually prefer this than the original. It's weird that after trying this system and going back to the normal turn-based.

After awhile, you can't even enjoy the music since you are way too powerful for the normal minions, Even on hard. Go in, all-out-attack and repeat. The mini-bosses are fun and should be integrated more and much more often. \n\n-In my 60 hour gameplay, I crashed 5 times. That's not really game breaking but a bit annoying. And it's random too. My pc specs is above average ( ryzen 7 3700x & RTX 3080 ). Your mileage might differ, but 5 times in 60 hrs is kinda annoying since there is no autosave. \n-Why release the sequel on multiple platforms and not the original? really weird decision making.\n\nConclusion\n-For persona 5 players : instant buy\n-normal people : play persona 5 first\n-for people who hate weeb stuff : hell no", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9c06f82ea77755a5980bf65bcbd5b8c3", "author": "823954989f01577fb44ab80839b64754", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 3959, "content": "nice", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9dd749367a35528b8eb94914a86277d2", "author": "37e5cfd0e1255bf7a1f25052d7acdada", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 1825, "content": "it good. port P5R to steam", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cf3ffb78624b5472b76a9d0efc4c2de6", "author": "a81421b8d43f5b7ea08e01fe71e08868", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 2776, "content": "quite honestly a pog game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9c9f6c772145540cb57d27500066fbb7", "author": "b0dcdcee3220538498f85a2d50469586", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 2199, "content": "P5\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0cP5S\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519\u5c31\u662f\u73a9\u4e45\u4e86\u5934\u6655\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u4e0aP5R\u554a", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8ea510d1cef75227b47a7a378af2bf66", "author": "48e16f1877b15b3696416f7e83f4b67e", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 536, "content": "It seemed promising as a warriors game since I love persona but quickly became more frustrating than anything", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a5d32925255652ea91d08ca6b66cb61c", "author": "763410aaa1b154c0b4b915f2df2ffd96", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 6883, "content": "\ub108\ubb34 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud558\uace0", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "04ede47475f05d8a94c8079268012f8b", "author": "5ed0c0cebcae56adbea679d15b49532b", "date": "2021-04-12", "hours": 5367, "content": "Such a great game!

Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5.

It's more affordable but will help you understand the basis of Persona. It's a good alternative if Strikers gameplay isn't right for you.\n` If you dislike the gameplay or the bland core character designs (the Metaverse forms look okay [Mark Zuckerberg is quaking rn]), this may not be a good Persona game for you. \n` Persona mainline games are turn and romance based while this is action and kill-em-all genre needing a controller. \n` Don't buy simply because it's Persona.\n` If you purchase this game-- get it on sale b/c full price expensive considering it's different from its mainline game!\n\nMy experience with the Persona franchise and Atlus: \n\n> I have played P4 Golden so I have high expectations for this game (PC gamer through Steam, no console besides 3DS or Wii [older sister's friend gave a hand-me-down Xbox One and his Switch to have space for a Steam Deck]). My previous Atlus games are Persona 4 Golden, Persona Q2 labyrinth, EOU, EOU2, SMT3 Nocturne, and if it counts-- BlazBlue Cross Tag [it's a mess, don't recommend it] and P4 Arena.\n\nLikes:\n\n> I enjoy the smooth game play, good models (as in construction and area layouts/buildings), and it's cool how they show character cut scenes when they talk and something important/dramatic comes up. Love the camera angles. I just finished the Alice arc and thought her castle had a simple get good design (not too cluttered and overbearing, it fit Alice nicely to contrast her appearance to the general public)\n\n> Kill-them-all style,, less romance focus\n\n> Fresh breath from turn based and a dancing game (not like turn based is bad, nor is dancing), this game is a great example of this action genre.\n\n> This is optimal with a controller. No need for pricey $200 controller, you broke college student.\n\nDislikes (I'm nitpicking especially when they had/have the chance to improve the series):\n\n> It still crashes,, was mad it crashed at the Metaverse school boss in the Alice arc\n\n> Uncomfortable scenes especially the hot spring scene where the guys didn't do anything wrong... I don't like the stereotype where the male characters get falsely accused and attacked despite saying the truth (this is subjective)\n\n> Phones confirmed to be in the early age of smart phones yet advanced (Ramen scene before cast left Shibuya,, you showed Sophia what a giant ramen bowl looks like with flipping your phone to the screen using the front camera [kinda creepy how she can use your camera when she wants-- she's giant tech companies in a nutshell] yet Sophia is able to detect jails with her nose meaning phones have 4D capabilities to smell) [UPDATE: They are super inconsistent,, in a fireworks/festival scene they have proven this otherwise]\n\n> Still kept the designs of P5 which could be fixed/updated with a DLC release. It is implied the team hasn't met up much during the summer and lots of changes happen in a few months when no school restrictions. P4 Golden showed the cast in summer if you got the good ending and how everyone's hair/clothes changed. [Ann is forever a knock off of Rise-- please make her more distinct than an idol girl with pigtails,,]\n\n> Designs are still from the 2008/early 2010s era. Give Haru bangs & a modern curly asymmetrical bob (she's a 5 head...) and redesign Sophia to look like a cool robot or maybe a NieR android (hell, Pixel and Zane from freakin' Ninjago have better designs to reflect the fact they aren't human). None of the clothes in this game is what you'd see in 2016-2021 and takes away from the fact that some of this game is \"futuristic\" like the Metaverse and smartphones/technology. \n\n> Strikers doesn't focus on flirting as there isn't social bonds (deal breaker for some and others not). Instead, you focus on action just like in mainstream Persona and has a kill-them-all style. \n\nGet this on sale-- full price isn't worth it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "89f44ea472525f668169d7fc7dd1eb0e", "author": "b3d5250a05ae5f34852610c7f36bb8a1", "date": "2021-04-11", "hours": 2875, "content": "A great sequel to Persona 5, and one of the best games the musou subgenre has to offer. P5\u2019s stylish and bold aesthetic perfectly mixes well with the musou genre. The Phantom Thieves\u2019 attacks are consistent to their original kit and are fluid. The new showtime attacks look awesome and are satisfying to use when facing a large enemy mob. Persona skills are still available and give you some time to breath during a battle, maintaining some of the turn-based mechanics from the original game. I feel more encouraged to switch between party members in this game since all of them have much higher utility in this game compared to the original game, where I would have a set party for a majority of the game. The persona elements help make the game feel less repetitive in combat since there\u2019s plenty of combos, abilities, and party members to try and use, which is a problem that plagues games in this subgenre.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves finally get some quality time together as they traverse across Japan to, which was much needed in the original game (looking at you Haru). There are plenty of moments during this road trip for fans of the game to enjoy. Zenkichi and Sophia are awesome additions to the main cast and have some of the most compelling character arcs in Persona 5. Villains in this game are more sympathetic than their P5 counterparts since most villains in Strikers were originally well-intentioned people before being twisted due to certain events. It\u2019s a welcome change.\nThe lack of social links is disappointing. Confidant abilities get replaced with bond skills that are useful, but very grindy to accumulate the points to maximize the skills without the dynamic building between Joker and the confidant. Most of the cast from P5 are nowhere to be referenced, which kinda sucks. I would\u2019ve at least liked the cast to mention how some of the side characters were spending their time in this game as a fan, but it\u2019s ultimately a neutral exclusion.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a game I\u2019d highly recommend to people who played Persona 5/Royal. Fans would enjoy seeing the Phantom thieves enjoy their quasi-summer vacation and more moments from their favorite members. Would I recommend it to people who have not played Persona 5 or Royal? Probably not since it\u2019s a direct sequel, but gameplay wise, it\u2019s one of the best musou games for sure.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a317db8928835d22adc50aca43cbe0b3", "author": "f799440b6aa553d69c72733c56ce251f", "date": "2021-04-11", "hours": 4939, "content": "It's a warriors game with a persona coat of paint what's not to love.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "21a4efe3ee295efea3f68423f2453416", "author": "275b0941abaf550eb674608c55bee8c8", "date": "2021-04-10", "hours": 2966, "content": "Un'interessante spin-off del capolavoro Persona 5, un must per chi ama i ladri fantasma", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f4aab9250ec15ab4a5b72c52a97d0ed0", "author": "1479379cac5a5064bd40f7b489a13d01", "date": "2021-04-10", "hours": 2342, "content": "8 out of 10 game for gameplay.\n\nHowever minus 1 point for no Adachi. \n\n7/10.

The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game.

I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found.

I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "73ce03f9b3b55657b926a4325f681d22", "author": "afa5e75f01da5f68b71e3dcdeee9363b", "date": "2021-04-09", "hours": 1996, "content": "I find myself very in between on this game I love Persona 4 & 5, the story and game play are fantastic, I also love the fast pace of Koei-Tecmo's Samurai/Dynasty warrior games. With that being said this game should totally be up my ally right. Well long story short I enjoyed the story, the game play was just OK. A lot of the time It was hard to follow what is going on in fights and the difficulty spike on the first mini boss was jarring. I think again story wise the game is pretty good more time with the phantoms thieves and overall comes to a satisfying conclusion. The game play is the weak point for me, I also wish the hub cities were bigger/had more to do, with all that the game is worth getting for story alone and the overall environments the jails present are visually really cool, but again I had trouble with the fighting/abilities or really investing in any of the other characters abilities( played joker pretty much exclusively) *spoiler really sucks if you haven't done this by the end of the game*. recommend for story but game play is hard to get into that's just my opinion.

It\u00b4s more time with the phantom thieves and their members, which is great. Sure, you dont have to manage school-life or your confidances, and battles are fought in real time, but it still FEELS all Persona 5-ey.

You just feel a different kind of rush and excitement when you have to control the movements of the thieves directly in battle, The change in genre fits surprisingly well (at least for me)!

Though of course, HIGHLY recommend that you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before entering here as you'll get to be more attached to the characters beforehand.\n\nI've never really played any kind of game like this in the past so I started on normal and that was already a good enough challenge personally. So don't worry about starting on normal if you're not looking for a challenge, that's why there's a merciless mode for those who want to challenge themselves. I think starting on hard mode is also a good enough challenge for those starting out. \nI think the gameplay is near perfect for those who want to either take it back and just play casually and those who really want to challenge themselves. The mechanics are simple but if you want to be able to maximise your output you have to be strategic with quite a lot of things. Combo's with normal attacks, combo's into your persona, and evading your enemy, while you can button mash, you'll get punished for not knowing what you do in hard boss fights and especially on merciless mode. Merciless will destroy you if you aren't being conscious of what you're doing in terms of attacks and spacial awareness, if you get caught by an enemy you'll most likely be dead, your entire party included.\nStarting on normal and then switching to hard later on I feel is the best thing to do. Normal will teach you the main mechanics well while hard will challenge you on using those mechanics to the best of your abilities. Merciless will challenge everything you have mechanics and resource wise. \n\nWhile the story isn't too heavy handed in terms of twists and complexity, it's a very enjoyable one with barely any bad moments. The dynamics between the characters are honestly written very well and they really do feel like a band of merry friends at the end of the day. And the new characters are amazing too, they're a very nice addition to the group.\nMusic is top notch, seriously, I don't have a single song I hate in this game. From city vibing, to the many and various battle themes, there's so much to enjoy.\nAnd I do love me some boss fights. I really do like all of them. While some have some annoying mechanics, they aren't frustrating to deal with.\n\nIf you've seen other reviews, then you've seen that this game has a complaint of crashing. And yes it does, I had quite a few in the beginning but I kind of learned a trick that could help others if you're having the issue as well.\nDuring transition screens whether that's areas, the metaverse, or after boss battles, that's where the game usually crashes (at least for me).

A third of P5R and half of P5. The combat here heavily resembles that of dynasty warriors, in which you have to fight off hordes of opponents in real time with 3 more phantom thieves by your side. The story here is kind of weak compared to P5R, but still really enjoyable and fulfilling besides. If you have played P5 or P5R, I'd highly recommend this game as despite the main 8 thieves not getting much character development (as they already got all of it from their confidants in P5), it is still nice seeing them ebb and flow off each other and the two new main characters.\n\nTime to go on a trip with P5S and steal back some desires.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0189e520b6fa5bd5af8f0c82d66305ec", "author": "c4e76e787beb5bbb9dbe637eb910010b", "date": "2021-04-07", "hours": 3372, "content": "I guess it's ok, but Akechi isn't in it", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a49e86e2d4485d228e14c60d8c820287", "author": "f732060c31d758918622edd91d5cbdda", "date": "2021-04-07", "hours": 5661, "content": "Ryuji finally says fuck.

Lots of button mashing and SP potions were required to get through but it was very very enjoyable.\n\nThat being said, it's not without its own technical problems; crashes at random times, with one lot always occurring at a specific point. That seemed to be down to the game not liking more than 16 logical cores being present and once the hyper-threading was turned off, it worked fine.

I would recommend playing the first game if you want to understand this game on a conceptual level. The gameplay is smooth and tight, the combat is fun.\n\nThe open combat style actually fits surprisingly well with the Persona roster of abilities and demons.

If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e4702e0861a3504a9abe3186e70a0072", "author": "d9a941b2e7f45c29a72a211b5abd1c87", "date": "2021-04-06", "hours": 1561, "content": "\uc5d4\ub529 \ubd24\uc74c. \uafc0\uc7bc.\n\uadfc\ub370 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc804\uc791 \uc548\ud574\ubd24\uc73c\uba74 \uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc774\ud574 \uc548\ub420\ub4ef.\n\n\uc804\uc791\uc5d0 \uc77c\uc815 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc11c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc774\ub294\uac70 \ub108\ubb34 \ud798\ub4e4\uace0 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uac00 \ud6c4\ubc18\uc5d0 \ub108\ubb34 \ub298\uc5b4\uc838\uc11c \uc811\uae34 \ud588\ub294\ub370 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud568.\n\uc77c\uc815 \ube61\ube61\ud55c\uac8c \ucde8\ud5a5\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub098\ub294 \uc804\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \ub108\ubb34 \ub298\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub0a0\uc9dc\uc5d0 \ubb54\uac00 \uc788\ub354\ub77c \ud558\ub294 \uc18c\ub9ac \ub4e3\uace0 \ud798\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc11c \uc811\uc5c8\ub2e4\uac00 \uad70\ub300 \uc804\uc5ed\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud574\ubcfc\ub824\ub2c8\uae4c \ub3c4\uc800\ud788 \uc5c4\ub450\uac00 \uc548\ub098\ub354\ub77c.\n\n\ud0a4\uc870\uc791 \uc774\uc0c1\ud574\uc11c \ub0b4 \uc784\uc758\ub300\ub85c \ud0a4\uc870\uc791 \ubc14\uafb8\uace0 \ud558\ub2c8\uae4c \ud560\ub9cc\ud568.\n\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud295\uae34\ub2e4\ub294 \uc18c\ub9ac \ub4e3\uace0 \uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788 \uc800\uc7a5\ud588\ub294\ub370 \ud55c\ubc88\ub3c4 \uc548 \ud295\uae40!!!!!!! \n\uac8c\uc784\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5d0 \ubc29\ud574 \ub420\ub9cc\ud55c \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud55c\ubc88\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc74c!!!!!!!\n\ubb50\uc57c 300\ub9cc\uc6d0 \uc9dc\ub9ac\ubcf4\ub2e4 150\ub9cc\uc6d0\uc9dc\ub9ac \ucef4\uc774 \ub354 \uc88b\uc740\uac74\uac00.\n\uc9c4\uc9dc \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ub3c4\uc911\uc5d0 \ubab0\uc785\uc5d0 \ubc29\ud574\ub420\ub9cc\ud07c \uc5b5\uc9c0\ub85c \ub098\uac00\uc11c \uc800\uc7a5 \ud560 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788 \ubb38\uc81c \uc548 \uc0dd\uae30\uac8c \ub178\ub825\ud588\ub294\ub370 \ubb38\uc81c \uac19\uc740\uac70 \uc548 \uc0dd\uaca8\uc11c \ud5c8\ud0c8\ud574\uc11c \uc801\ub294 \ub9d0\uc784\n\ubb50 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud55c\uac74\uc9c0\ub294 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub294\ub370 \uc77c\ub2e8 \ud295\uae34\ub2e4\uac70\ub098 \uac80\uc740\ud654\uba74 \ub4f1\ub4f1 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \ub098\ub294 \uc774\ud574 \ubabb\ud558\uaca0\uc74c.\n\n69800\uc6d0\uc744 \ud6c4\ud68c \uc548 \ud560\ub9cc\ud07c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc990\uacbc\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud568.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "484a9e8da0dd5d43ae874d451a25b705", "author": "1102207cb51852fd8530a06c97c73026", "date": "2021-04-06", "hours": 2136, "content": "Ryuji is now holding the F word pass.

The OST, group, and overall atmosphere was something I really enjoyed. With Persona 5 Strikers coming, I was looking forward to catching up with the Phantom Thieves. Seeing the characters and the world yet again felt a burst of memories from the original title. This game mixes up its gameplay with introducing a more Dynasty Warriors feel (well, it's made by the developers). So the game is HEAVY on the mobs of enemies you face with each character having their own personal combos/moves to perform in combat. The \"Palace\" aspect for the dungeons has been changed (won't say for spoiler sake), but it's more or less the same format. \n\nComing up on my personal opinion of the game being halfway through, it's kinda... meh? It's not a bad thing in no way, but the game does tend to just be rinse and repeat constantly. Gameplay is good enough to continue playing, but the story just kinda wanes as it goes by. If you're someone who wanted to wait for a sale, I say do so. You're not gaining or losing anything from playing/not playing the game. It's just more Persona 5. If that's what you've been yearning for, you won't be disappointed in that regard. The OST is great as usual for a Persona game. My overall first impressions of everything are fairly solid.

uninspired dungeons that all play out the exact same, but the second half has more uniquely designed dungeons with enjoyable game play and writing that makes up for the weak first half. p5 cast is also just enjoyable as characters which is nice, and the combat is fun.\n\nPROS:\nthe combat is fun and blends JRPG and warriors style combat together incredibly well\n\nzenkichi hasegawa, sophia, kuon ichinose, and akira konoe were pretty well written and i liked them\n\nmost of the soundtrack is pretty good\n\nit gives characters who needed more development and screen time what they need\n\nthe writing of the cast was surprisingly fine for a spin off game i personally expected atlus to do the thing where they reduce characters personalities down to just two traits, but theyre pretty fine in p5s.\n\nMIXED: theres no real difficulty in this game, because of the way the jails are designed you can just enter and exit them with no penalty, meaning that loss of SP and HP are meaningless, combined with the fact that due to various upgrades you can end the game with ABSURD amounts of items that can give you much more upgraded healing & support than necessary. this isnt bad to me, as it can allows for more accessibility by default of being easier, but people expecting a challenge will have to go out of their way to make it harder (although i have heard merciless is actually pretty difficult, i have not started a merciless playthrough)\n\nsome songs on the soundtrack, although still good, sound more like generic video game music rather than the style p5s was going for, which left me dissapointed as the persona series never fails with its soundtracks.\n\nCONS:\nfirst half of the game. its monotonous and the plot is horribly sluggish.\n\nall of the dungeons felt the exact same in the first half which is never a good thing\n\nmost of the villains arent really anything good, which i dont mind the characters that are meant to be important are well written, but i wish theyd be atleast a bit more memorable or a bit more worth being someone im supposed to dislike, but its to be expected, the persona series has never been too good when it comes to any nonmajor villains.\n\nthe plot & villains are all just weaker p5, lots of the villains, just feel like weaker versions of the original. p5s's plot isnt even bad, its just that you know pretty much everything thats gonna happen the moment you realize that the story is just trying to copy its original.\n\noverall the game is good and the game is fun. thats what matters. id say around 90% of the time i had a smile on my face, even when in the early half when it did feel monotonous and unoriginal, the p5 cast and the combat always managed to make me have an enjoyable time, but its flaws are definetly existant, and noticable.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id":

felt weird that they were making a canonical sequel to the original. But honestly, this game really really impressed me. It felt like Persona 5 in pretty much every aspect. It didn't feel like a budget title, they really went all out. From what I understand, this is probably the best game Omega Force has put out.\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ More time with the main cast\n+ The whole english dub crew being back is great.\n+ The main plot was pretty good. A bit more predictable than P5/R, but still really nice and better than I expected.\n+ The two new characters are great, [Spoiler]Gramps[/spoiler] in particular. \n+ Surprisingly fleshed out city locations that give some of those P5 vibes\n+ Ran really well on my 8700k/2060. 1440p @ 60fps, super sampled quite a bit. After that, it loses that jagged look of the consoles and looks just like the original.\n\nNit-picks (These are all really minor):\n- Persona 5 Royal is non-canon in this sequel, which stinks.\n- It doesn't acknowledge your relationship from the original. (Which I completely understand would be a lot to ask, it just throws my head-canon off a bit when Makoto seems to forget we were dating.)\n- There is one particular achievement to max out all of the BOND skills... which is insanely grindy, and dissuades me from 100%'ing the game. All the other achievements are really fair, but this one is just horrible. \n- You get overpowered rather quickly after the first jail, I never really had to decide which character to spend money on. I could simply just buy everyone the best weapon and armor the moment they became available. \n- You can tell the english dub had to record from their closets at home, so the audio levels are a bit off sometimes. \n\nA couple of spoiler-free tips:\n- Upgrade the Bondmaker skill as soon as it is available.\n- Unlock all the party members Master Arts ASAP. They are fun to use, and don't take much effort to unlock.\n- Make sure you google how to get your game looking nice. The default settings really don't look that good. You don't have to mod, you just need to make a couple changes.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "68510a6ae28d5ca097c91e46c5a0f7e3", "author": "15787cfeaa855225b05028bd6ad9b2ec", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 2833, "content": "where is the Persona 5 PC port?!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8669ece53f1854869e296ce884aaec38", "author": "68d9262216fc5edfadd49c34be9648b8", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 1441, "content": "COOL GAME I CAN BE JOKER AND I LOOK LIKE JHOKER IN REAL LIFE", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6a8c497db28a5cb49cf645962b8645c5", "author": "8249993a38fa5d12bb076b9e15349afc", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 385, "content": "Je d\u00e9conseil ce jeu tant qu'il ne vireront pas leur logiciel anti piratage qui fait cracher constament les joueurs honnette.\nLe jeu n'ayant pas de sauvegarde automatique, il arrive qu'il crach apres 40 minute de jeu et qu'on soit obliger de tout refaire.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "57809204da9b53deb8fb9b82780cd8d6", "author": "1a1c17c4bdba551eba17653be64b9be3", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 2558, "content": "Ann a baddy. 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c0e18ff72a15ed7a2fb97687fb06fd3", "author": "bba3a51f4e0b5523a0492f1196031f8c", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 1005, "content": "I loved Persona 2-5r, this game isn't worth loving, it has many bugs and very cringe writing with already out of date references, unless atlus fixes the crashing issue, this game is not worth picking up.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "489f00736276585db8739c1e5f71f540", "author": "64ababf2f7d15735b5acd10ec128b733", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 5, "content": "no ultrawide support? for a $70 game? what?

However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "152152af9f8c53d38781bde1d5e9ba85", "author": "f9b40194d1435058a94d475b9654aaff", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 3727, "content": "Tr\u00e8s bon jeu dans son genre, les combats sont tr\u00e8s cool et la musique qui les accompagne rend vraiment le jeu tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able \u00e0 jouer.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d9070ce227a25f5e98964e34b0b605fb", "author": "3497dfe2ac8558579e3db33699533ebc", "date": "2021-04-05", "hours": 946, "content": "A direct sequel to Persona 5 with a beat'em Up+Summons gameplay with light Social Links/Confidants relationships system. \n\nI had a crash to desktop once, not sure how or why.

What I love about Persona was the stories and life-sim aspects, and to a lesser extent the style the series just oozes at all times. Which, unfortunately, Persona 5 Strikers does lack in - there is no real life-sim aspect, and it still has style to it though perhaps not as much as the game it was based off of, but the story is still there and in full force - very enjoyable\n\nI do think that Strikers is quite difficult compared to its mainline entry, but that comes with the territory of an action-based vs. turn-based game. Since I'm not interested, I played on easy, and I still find that Strikers is too difficult for my liking. I know, I know, get good, but again - not my cup of tea, I'm here for the story.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is an intermittent crashing. My first 8 hours or so were fine, but the next few have seen a number of frustrating crashes... I really don't want to have to play parts over and over again, but I find myself needing to. \n\nOverall though, want more Persona? Here you go.

So far I am really enjoying myself. I love how it does feel like a sequal to persona 5( Although I wish is was a sequal to Royal.) I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes. I've only finished the first dungeon right now, but haven't encountered any issues at the moment which is nice since so many new games nowadays has some type of issues.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8b83d0aaf3b652ba9e2e2ce61b1220e3", "author": "798635e703e65bdca0358b76761b5331", "date": "2021-04-04", "hours": 4297, "content": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nhighly recommend playing after finishing persona 5 royal!!!!! super fun gameplay once u get used to it and i enjoyed the story and it was nice to see a new side to some of my dearly beloved characters \u2665\nalso absolutely BANGER!!! music. holy crap. playplayplayplayplayplay it\n\n((- 1 \u2605 just bc it doesn't have goro akechi >:(. only flaw.))

If you did this game is much more than just a musou and I definitely recommend it.\n\nWhile it doesn't have social links and the calendar system this game is pretty much a sequel to Persona 5.\n\nAlmost all the elements from the original turn-based combat system are also present in the new real time combat of Strikers even if they work a bit differently. Affinities, skills, Persona fusion (obviously not to the same extent), the dungeon crawling; it's all there and it's fun!\n\nThe story doesn't only take place in Shibuya this time, it's a roadtrip across Japan and the changing scenery/locations constantly keep things interesting. The new characters are great, the music is fantastic as always. All the characters play differently with their own unique mechanics and due to the affinity system you need to pick the right party and persona loadout for Joker for the right bosses/encounters.\n\nThe story is decent, it starts out very solid but unfortunately runs out of steam close to the end. The pacing is all over the place. The last boss is [spoiler]pretty much the same as the one from vanilla Persona 5 (literally the same being if you know a bit about gnosticism...)[/spoiler], so I wasn't really paying much attention at the end anymore, it just felt like a repeat and the phantom thieves were saying very similar lines that didn't have much of an impact anymore.\n\nThe combat can get very tedious especially in the late game. Even on Normal difficulty some bosses and shadows will have very high HP pools while your party members can die in 2-3 hits. You spend alot of time just whittling away at their life until you manage to knock them down for an all out attack which maybe does like 10% of their HP. I understand they wanted the combat to be more strategic and focused on exploiting enemy weaknesses but at some point it just stops being fun. Especially when the party member AI occasionally has a brain fart and just lets bosses one shot them with highly telegraphed attacks.\n\nDespite all this I still had a very good time with Strikers and I think anyone who liked Persona 5 also will.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2bfd375f185b5cb7be1040ee647edf75", "author": "04b05a4807f0526fb98038d5f3d2684c", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 2873, "content": "If you loved the characters of Persona 5 then you're gonna love this as well.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "337c46150e235fdbb5d957c952bc7637", "author": "e222014b52c35e889ae42197ae5f928c", "date": "2021-04-03", "hours": 1200, "content": "This game has a Persona 5 theme, with a  Kingdom Hearts / Beatem up style gameplay.

[/b]\nAvere tutte queste cure o potenziamenti in un gioco a turni come i precedendi \u00e8 un conto , perch\u00e8 il turno ti permette di usarle  con parsimonia e una per volta , invece qui potete usarle in qualunque momento a decine tutte assieme semplicemente aprendo l'inventario e mettendo in pausa il gioco.\n\nAltra problematica sono le subquest che non ho finito perch\u00e8 sono veramente ripetitive , moltissime inutili a livello di trama e peggiorano la situazione di facilit\u00e0 generale del gioco.\nMa superato questo aspetto , il gioco \u00e8 molto divertente , diverso dal solito , e con una trama un po sempliciotta , ma ben fatta. SPOILER [spoiler] non ci sono romance , ma solo missioni amicizia. [/spoiler]\n\nCome longevit\u00e0 non \u00e8 male , circa 50 60 ore senza completare tutte le sub-quest\nCome grafica anche se molto easy ha molto stile,  scorre sempre  fluido lockato a 60 fps   e non ho riscontrato nessun bug.\nLa colonna sonora \u00e8 semplicemente stupenda e alcuni brani sfruttano veramente bene gli effetti stereofonici.\n\nSe lo trovate sui 25 euro non fatevelo scappare , meglio sarebbe giocarlo dopo persona 5 royal sperando anche che  Atlus si decida a farlo uscire su steam.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 19, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "caee56c534eb5a9c82b61dbcf076cc0b", "author": "1e5a0b6405c556e78a652122a9800bce", "date": "2021-04-01", "hours": 3779, "content": "fuck", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "27fb14cee737585093ee1e690ac957bb", "author": "cfc8f2203be35518b5c4ef9a5af17019", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 439, "content": "The gameplay is pretty simple and easy to understand. HOWEVER, some significant flaws like aiming guns are broken as your crosshair moves up and down like an earthquake simply from moving it in either left or right directions.\n\nThe store is also watered down a tad as you used to be able to sell all your junk with a push of a button in persona 5. with strikers, you must sell each item individually as the \"sell all junk\" button does not exist anymore.\n\nEverything else gameplay-wise was fine from what I have seen except for some exploits due to how far you can jump to places, and in certain areas, if you look up, you can pass entier areas without going to the actual entrance, which I accidentally did and backtracked to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe story is..... how to put it..... probably the worst thing about this game. The removal of all the supporting members from the game and being left with just a few new ones hurt the story badly. The hub world feels empty because of this, as there is nothing to do or get more investment in the story (at least from what I saw from beating the first palace). \nThe story also feels completely unrelated to me, as the stakes for beating any of the palaces are super low. While in the first game, the cops in the story would have arrested you the moment you were suspicious, even at the last scene of the game. In this one, it feels like no one cares (except for one guy) despite you being a phantom thief. You actually had severe consequences in the story in the first one, but in this game, it's just a straight path with some little stumbles and no risk. Maybe it gets better after the first palace, but I didn't care to continue as it felt pointless. i could compare this to mementos side stories, but with extra flair. that's basically it.\n\nI'm sure some people love this stuff, and gameplay-wise, it's obviously not bad. But for me, this was just boring to continue, which is ironic considering this game has more action in it than persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "835ad1edc657573ea841f362627dab6c", "author": "efb319b3a80f599592656340bfd27120", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 9505, "content": "Game play is engaging, music is perfect, characters are amazing, what more could you ask for.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3302be6d2b0557f3bc03504e3005625d", "author": "871c3b51319e5072a662b90570c4cda6", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 910, "content": "i'm da joker baby", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "79f154b1c5095eb7a4d0596cf2199ef9", "author": "8ef058b95ef65288a40f9b07687d1f37", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 1289, "content": "Aun no termino este juego, pero puedo decir que Atlus lo hiciste bien y estuvimos 6 A\u00d1OS para que sacaran un juego asi :c", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "12b376a38d1952e4be3ff4f6c84ed316", "author": "2237aaddee8159a7b8c978e544eb3b8f", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 1875, "content": "im enjoying it but i cant recommend the game honestly, dodging i absolute shit making combat infuriating, and theres a good chance the game will crash on you after a hard boss fight", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "273b9afa9dc45c13a0584a03f2681b66", "author": "1172db53d61a5f13aef55ed581d99f53", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 5782, "content": "An easy recommendation.

However it comes very close! I picked up the digital deluxe edition and loved every second of it. In fact, I think the overall story was much better than the original P5 game. Don't get me wrong, I still love both stories but I think the Monarchs make so much better antagonists than the Palace Rulers. I love how this game took the idea of the Phantom Thieves and brought the question of how humanity acts and relies on free will and isolation. I felt like all of the Monarchs were in the position that they are purely because of how they fell off their paths in life instead of just being pure evil. This led to the change of hearts being much more believable and made me wonder how the Monarchs got to be the leaders of the jail every time I got to a new one and how we were going to save them. Overall, this game improves the concept of the Phantom Thieves and brings a brand new game play style that works together so well.

The writing is incredible as always and the characterization and interactions are arguably better than og persona 5 and royal.  The setting of the game as a summer roadtrip around Japan is genius and was a great breath of fresh air besides the familiar area of Shibuya.  The two main new characers Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions especially Zenkichi.  The visuals are also very pretty and refined especially the in-game cut scenes which honestly looked better than the anime cut scenes.  Overall I wanted more persona 5 and that's what this game gives you, exactly what I needed around this time.  The only complaints I have are the persona system with joker could be done a little better compared to previous p5 games, Lavenza and the velvet room in general should've been used in the plot a bit more or just change things up and make it more unique rather than \"Oh guess what you're a trickster of fate again\", and the plot near the end is pretty predictable and similar to P5R.  I can see why people don't like Sophia as well being the whole AI learns about the concepts of humanity thing but Sophia's interactions and expressions were very cute so it made up for it.  Every character gameplay wise is incredibly fun the best in my opinion being Makoto, Ryuji, and wolf(won't say who wolf is cuz spoilers) but the only complaint I have gameplay wise is Sophia, in a muso game I want to do big flashy moves or badass combos, with so much happening on the screen why would I want to practice timing perfect catches with a yoyo for sophia's combos how can I read her catches while watching every other enemy and dodging attacks, functionally her bless magic and healing are very helpful but that's all I really used her for her magic for bosses and mini bosses who were weak to bless or just healing team members she's the only character I found my self barely using in combat.\nOverall 9/10 very surprised and excited to do New Game +", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7264e6a36b1658eb9c8053c11be9e26d", "author": "884aa39717ac5425a43403a75eeffc75", "date": "2021-03-31", "hours": 3706, "content": "Very fun sequel to the original Persona 5 so you don't need to play the Royal version to enjoy it.

If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention some of the personas need to be fuse with a the early personas at certain level for example, King Frost - Lvl 40 Jack Frost + Lvl 40 Jack O' Lantern. Jack frost should be around level 20 when you get him, and Jack O Lantern is Level 8, So if you didnt level them up or dont have enough Persona points, it is gonna take some time to get some of the personas.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "882234c05aaa565aa501589135ed93c0", "author": "0025c9eb7bc55bfa817fb48faf1508de", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 2841, "content": "Futaba has a hat now\n10/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6353d2f779705e309ef0d187b8ef0bc0", "author": "fb7fec8b8dbf517c8f0b552b876d2b2f", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 5060, "content": "\u6e38\u620f\u5f88nice\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6253boss\u771f\u7684\u522e\u75e7\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u628a\u5168\u5c4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u90a3\u4e48\u5927\u4e2a\u5c4f\u5e55\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e48\u5c0f\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u753b\u9762\u770b\u7684\u5c2c\u6b7b\u4e86", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3b3e2d56f5f65c38849b29b672fa1589", "author": "c6a2f5a18b1550c5a03ca665017a9859", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 5467, "content": "Ryuji est\u00e1 hasta los cojones\n\n10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "569d86b0c4915b8fa0630f7606c38450", "author": "3b4a3eea4c745ac2a11d763102ca568f", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 7798, "content": "\u4eb2\u7231\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u95e8\uff0c\u60f3\u628aP5S\u5f53\u65e0\u53cc\u73a9\u4e48\uff1f\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u51fb\u7834RISKY\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6b7b\u795e\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u9053\u5177\u201c\u5168\u80fd\u771f\u7403\u201d\uff1a\u9664\u4e07\u80fd\u5c5e\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u4f60\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u7686\u4e3a0\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4f60\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u5fc3\u7684\u4e3a\u6240\u6b32\u4e3a\u7684\u65e0\u53cc\u4e86\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f5a70406a17516fa537c77cdec62c51", "author": "2ec4e09350375a8a85dd4bccc122c3e7", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 3161, "content": "\u95ea\u9000\u592a\u6076\u5fc3\u4e86\uff0c\u603b\u662f\u5728\u6253\u5b8cboss\u770b\u597d\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5267\u60c5\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8bfb\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u95ea\u9000\uff0c\u671f\u95f4\u8fd8\u6ca1\u529e\u6cd5\u4fdd\u5b58", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5626c25d21d95dbc8be7f069185e8972", "author": "de7525f525f052aabdb0cb7de5d34342", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 2788, "content": "Haru.

Not gonna work.\" \n\nThe more I looked into it, the more it started to grow on me. Ended up pre-ordering sometime in January. Got it 3 days early because of the Deluxe order. Wow.\n\nI am so glad I picked this up. I fell in love with the Persona series when I got to try out Persona 4. Dark, Gritty, comical and pretty real when it came to terms and understanding characters. Played the original and P4 Golden. Absolutely loved every aspect of the game. Saw it released on steam and bought it without even thinking. :)\n\nThen P5 was announced!\nPre-orderd the box set before the prices when to crap before release. Completely loved the game and finished it.\nPersona 5 Royal. . . . CRAP! got to get it! Started to replay the game with the extras and to experience the new section of the story. Got about 76 hours into the game and lost everything past the 16 hour mark after a brown out. Forgot to upload to PS plus. Also, long story short. PS4 Pro, No Internal harddrive. Modified external with 8tb Barracuda Pro. Every brownout/ loss of power wiped the drive. After that happened, 2 tb SSD with the 8tb in a usb3 case. Works fine now but added a 1000 UPS unit to it. Honestly haven't touched it since\n\nStrikers though, I was positively blown away by how well this worked. A Dynasty Warriors take on Persona is certainly refreshing way to spin off an already great game. All of the characters we know and love are spot on and the VA's reprized their rolls wonderfully{save for Joker}. Absolutely love Zenkichi and Sophia and the parts they play. The gameplay was fluid and fast paced when needed and the music from the original games and the reprized Musou variants plus their original takes work perfectly for the new style of gameplay. Even the subtle change in the music when you went into the sneak sections was a pleasing change. I wonder how many people caught onto that change when they played those parts.\n\nThe story played out very well and was a pretty good length. I was surprised that it totaled almost 33 hours without doing the extra mission. It is pretty engrossing if you ask me with all of the comical, stereotypical, and serious character building while keep the balance of surreal, light, and dark positions each and every character goes through and faces during each mission or challenge.\n\nAll in all. The Highlights about the games really to make this a great play Save for the few things that I have found that started to break the immersion of the game. First off, The VA's did a wonderful job playing their parts but I found that the sound balancing in the game started to break the game. I was finding out that alot of the music did not lower when the characters spoke and alot of time the Va's voice would start to blend or even be overpowered by the music. I heard this alot when Skull spoke his dialogue. He even had a few lines that were inaudible or something that was completely non-exhistant when he talked. The constant crashing when the game was first released, which thankfully, was fixed with the beta update they released a week or so later. But when I really started to see was the slowdown during gameplay or in full on battles. I was well above the Recommended when I was running it first on my I5 6500, OLOy DDR4 2666{Limited to 2400 because of processor}, and my 1060 GXT SSC card. I kept getting slowdowns when I had alot of effects going on in game with more than 6 enemies on screen. It was the worse when I made it to the underground \"sewer\" part of the first Prison. The section near the end of the \"sewer\" part where the water was on the floor at the end of the dungen.  Upgraded the Processor and motherboard while keeping my memory and Vid card. Ryzen 5 3600X. was the processor upgrade and the game played almost flawlessly. Even got better framerates that stayed constant 60FPS even in the final dungeon where there were up to 50+ enemies on the field. I also found it strange that there were side quest mini bosses that were incredibly hard when compared to the normal Bosses and End game boss. I died more on those side quest bosses then I did on the Main ones. Once you started to get up in levels, the enemies became to easy which made it hard to start to complete the Character quests and Move sets. Maybe I will mess with it soon in a harder difficulty mode to see if my current Mode playthrough was the reason.\n\nNow, my last quip was Joker. I guess they could not get the original VA? I mean, His voice was alot more gruff at certain points but they used alot of his Persona 5 voice clips. It was very off putting listening to him. Other than that. It was a great game and was very enjoyable to play. Now I'll just wait for any expansions or new unlockable to see in game. Heres Hoping. ;)\n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "877fe35683be5c4fb81da29d56f5befc", "author": "63839a99016e51fcaaa090d341bda339", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 3080, "content": "A sequel to Persona 5 thinly veiled as Persona Warriors.

First off is the fact that the game likes crashing a lot and it also has a few glitches which might force you to close, which really sucks when you spend 30 minutes on the final boss fight and it crashes the next cutscene and I have to fight the boss all over again.\n\nNext is the story in General: If you played Persona 5, then you know the story of Persona 5: Strikers. There are bad guys in these palace like jails and it's up to the Phantom Thieves to change their hearts and take back their desires. Of course there is actually a false god who has been secretly pulling the strings and manipulating everything. It feels like you are playing a watered down fanfiction rather than an actual sequel with how similar it is to the main story. The only unique part of the story being Sophia but even then her plot is barely touched until the very end.\n\nNext are the characters: The main cast is back but it doesn't feel like they are back. They all act like parodies of themselves, like someone saw one scene in Persona 5 and based their entire personality off it. While its charming at first listening to the cast talk and crack jokes, there is only so many times we can hear about Ryuji's food obsession or Makoto's fist of justice or Yusuke being poor. The villains are all forgettable, their backstory is paper thin and the game tries to make it seem like they are morally grey characters or arent truly evil, but they dont even keep this pattern up half the time. Some villains are complete assholes who murder their parents, while others are boring and barely even criminals, like the guy who wrote a bad book. It felt like there was an attempt to make a villain who is good, but uses the wrong method like Takuto Maruki from Royal, but they all fall short. Maruki worked so well because he was a good guy and actually was attempting to do good, even if his methods and ways were wrong. The villains that try to seem redeemable are all murders whose control other people to force them to do their bidding. Even the twist villain who everyone could see coming just felt dry, like they needed someone to explain why EMMA even became a god in the first place.\n\nGameplay: The game play seems fun at first, but it quickly gets old after a while, it is just beat up the enemy, move forward, wow another ambush, beat up the enemy, fight a 10 minute mini boss, fight a 30 minute boss. There is just too much combat that feels unrewarding and dry, The time outside of the metaverse feels empty, like a poor imitation of the main games open world. The time progression system is completely uselss, and there is little to do outside except shop for groceries so you can have more sp and complete side request which just waste more time. Every area felt the same with no uniqueness, every battle felt the same, learn the enemies weaknesses and spam the move that works. Unlike the main game, which had a lot of flair, each battle lacks anything close to the art style and flair of the main game as you see all the game has to offer in about and hour of game play. God bless anyone who didnt buy the Legacy music because I could not stand listening to the same three combat songs over and over again. \n\nOverall this game is not worth $60, maybe $40 but i wouldn't go any higher, just wait for a sale if you really want it, also atlus pls fix your game I want to go one cutscene without crashing pls", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "24a222e3b65c53eaade2783ac078b78f", "author": "8fb22ffa33695d498cb59e876a12b7f0", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 1733, "content": "\u5973\u795e\u5f02\u95fb\u5f55\u771f\u4ed6\u5988\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e70\u5c31\u5b8c\u4e8b\u4e86\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u8d35\u70b9\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u597d", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b10b37d8288d55b8a62ded714ee7275f", "author": "116f032646545dfdbd9d24844bb65d25", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 3807, "content": "akechi got snubbed for real", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "133f3bdafcc35b81877bf8418f750499", "author": "99878baeb79f5441b80d44a621baa17d", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 2391, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers \u00e9tait mon premier et s\u00fbrement mon dernier Musou (type de jeu entre un beat'em all et un hack'n'slash).\nJe connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce concept de jeu via les Dynasty Warriors, auquel je n'ai jamais jou\u00e9 car peu int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par les combats contre 200 ennemis \u00e0 l'IA quasi inexistante. \nCependant, ayant ador\u00e9 Persona 5, qui m'a s\u00e9duit par son gameplay, le syst\u00e8me de force/faiblesse et de fusion des Personae, sa prise en main facile et son univers tr\u00e8s sympathique, je me suis laiss\u00e9 tenter par Persona 5 Strikers pour continuer l'histoire des Voleurs Fant\u00f4mes.\n\nLe jeu est sympathique mais me laissera un souvenir p\u00e9rissable. J'ai fait le jeu en mode normal, les 3/4 des qu\u00eates annexes et voil\u00e0 ce que je lui reproche : \n\n- Le jeu crashe parfois, et aux pires moments. Souvent apr\u00e8s une cin\u00e9matique, sur un chargement de nouvelle zone. Je pense avoir subi une dizaine de crashs au total, dont un pendant les dialogues de fin du jeu, m'obligeant \u00e0 me retaper le boss final (pas si dur, heureusement (?))\n\n- On retrouve le charme des menus \u00e0 la Persona 5, mais pas d'\u00e9volution pour un jeu plus dynamique. En plein combat, surtout pendant les plus longs, on passe des sessions de 30 \u00e0 40 secondes \u00e0 chercher l'objet qui rend la bonne quantit\u00e9 de vie, de points d'action, qui gu\u00e9rit le statut ... tout \u00e7a est class\u00e9 par nombre de points rendus, mais le jeu compte \u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'items diff\u00e9rents aux effets similaires, ce qui rend la t\u00e2che vraiment chiante.\n\n- En parlant d'items, et plus particuli\u00e8rement de nourriture, le voyage dans le jeu m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la mise en avant de nombreux plats locaux, qui d'apr\u00e8s les personnages, sont plus d\u00e9licieux les uns que les autres mais... on ne les voit jamais. Pas une illustration de ramen, d'okonomiyaki, de takoyaki, de curry, de sushi ... on pourrait croire que ce n'est qu'un d\u00e9tail, mais la bouffe fait partie int\u00e9grante du jeu, on nous en parle tout le temps, on peut cuisiner, j'\u00e9tais donc tr\u00e8s d\u00e9\u00e7u de ne pas voir au moins une fois un de ces mets typiques.\n\n- Ensuite, les combats et la difficult\u00e9 en dents de scie. La plupart des combats contre les monstres classiques se torchent en une vingtaine de secondes. Ici, on les lance en touchant un ennemi, comme dans un RPG classique. 3 types de combats diff\u00e9rents : \n=> Les ennemis badiques : souvent, les combats sont torch\u00e9s en 20 secondes quand ils sont de notre niveau. On spamme le bouton d'attaque, on lance un sort et c'est termin\u00e9. \u00c0 la fin, un de nos co\u00e9quipiers nous congratule d'un \"C'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fini ? J'ai failli m'endormir !\". Moi aussi.\n=> Les ennemis robustes : Ceux-l\u00e0 donnent un peu plus de fil \u00e0 retordre, mais m'ont donn\u00e9 la sensation d'\u00eatre surtout des sacs \u00e0 PV plus qu'autre chose. On tape, on tape, on lance un sort jusqu'\u00e0 ne plus avoir de magie, les combats s'\u00e9ternisent un peu plus et ne demandent pas trop de skill, \u00e0 par \u00e9ventuellement c\u00f4t\u00e9 timing pour l'esquive.\n=> Les boss : M\u00eame souci, de vrais sacs \u00e0 PV. Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 les combats satisfaisants, on n'est pas du tout sur le m\u00eame type de jeu mais je trouve la tension d'un combat de boss de Soulborne bien plus satisfaisante et challengeante.\nPour finir sur les combats, apr\u00e8s avoir vu des vid\u00e9os \u00e0 droite \u00e0 gauche des Dynasty Warriors et du dernier Zelda Age of Calamity, j'avoue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi d\u00e9\u00e7u des environnements ou des zones de combats bien plus restreintes qui tuaient un peu le mood. On a l'impression de se battre dans une petite bo\u00eete aux murs transparents.\n\n\nLe jeu reste tout de m\u00eame correct mais j'avoue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 assez lass\u00e9 de ces soucis qui se pr\u00e9sentent tout au long du jeu ... Tout n'est pas \u00e0 jeter, j'ai tout de m\u00eame appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 d'autres aspects du jeu : \n\n- Les personae : On les retrouve (s\u00fbrement ?) tous dans le jeu, avec leurs capacit\u00e9s, les fusions, et le fait que leurs attaques s'int\u00e8grent tr\u00e8s bien dans le jeu et dans les combos des personnages.\n- Les attaques de base de tous les personnages font leurs effets, on d\u00e9bloque rapidement des am\u00e9liorations de combos tr\u00e8s sympathiques et chacun des personnages \u00e0 son point fort\n- Les zones : m\u00eame si j'ai trouv\u00e9 les \"donjons\" (ici les prisons) pas folichonnes niveau d\u00e9cor, c'\u00e9tait encore un plaisir de se balader dans les diff\u00e9rentes villes dont les quartiers sont encore bien mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s. \u00c7a donne envie d'y aller en vrai.\n- Les musiques, le doublage quasi int\u00e9gral, la traduction sans faute et de qualit\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais.\n\n[b]J'ai quand m\u00eame pass\u00e9 un assez bon moment sur ce jeu, mais je ne le conseille pas \u00e0 tout le monde. Je pense que celui-ci conviendra surtout aux fans++ de Persona, qui ont envie de se replonger dans l'univers, et qui ont envie de tester un autre type de gameplay que le tour par tour classique. Pour les autres, passez votre chemin, il y a plein d'autres jeux qui vont plairont s\u00fbrement plus :)[/b]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 20, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "055e43b460145026937bc0a800c58e05", "author": "a4e84304f85457dc9b7cc9ff35ac52c7", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 613, "content": "\uc774\uc81c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub0985 \ubcf8\ud3b8 \ub098\uc62c\ub584\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc228 \ucc38\ub294\ub2e4", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "500c1060c9255e3a957467b06344b70d", "author": "6648f0dfe9c55d9697bfac8f90eb87ec", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 5890, "content": "games fuckin good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "53993279061c532dbfd5b95d4a3fd085", "author": "addf4d635d0f502c9f68eb9529ed19ed", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 3177, "content": "This game is practically Persona 5 Lite. Contains a lot from base Persona 5, except social links and a restricted free roam. Time does not pass in this game when you do any sort of action, but instead only passes through story. It does feel rather cheaply made at first, though, since you can't run while free roaming, and all but two non party confidants were completely removed from the game because of [strike] low budget [/strike] convenient reasons. However, it shouldn't take much time to adjust to this.\n\nThe only gripe I can give this game is the combat. It works, but it's not great. Be warned, you will be dropped from full HP to 0 in less than a second many times in this game, and that's the game's biggest issue. I don't think they realized just how strong enemy moves were, so when you have 7 of them doing the same move all at once, it packs one hell of a punch. The majority of persona moves are also rather useless. Really, I never once used a physical skill, and I only used a magic skill a hand full of times. The only worth while skills in this game are stat buffs/debuffs, heals, and passives. Everything else, including skills like concentrate and charge, are completely worthless. Also, anything that was meant to hit all targets in the base game is also completely useless. It just costs more SP with a wider area of affect. Normal trash enemies don't need any debuffs to fight. The only thing you should use debuffs on is for anything that has a health bar on the top of the screen, and since it's only one enemy, you can save double the SP for just using the smaller area of effect debuffs.\n\nOverall, it's Persona 5 through and through with the only major change being Action RPG combat.

It has all of the charm of P5 and P5R, I was itching for more Persona 5 after finishing Royal and this is a very nice change of pace while still tying beautifully into the original story.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ee9b2cfd7c2256ca9d61db5833655132", "author": "a5ea5b927b2c577b8b0adddb5c2e367f", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 3296, "content": "fuck", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4195961a4024554aa9059a4ab61bff44", "author": "c301c3606ca25eb7ae81c76a75de9828", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 1891, "content": "Sinceramente n\u00e3o recomendo, esperava mais do jogo no tocante a historia, acaba sendo mais do mesmo que voc\u00ea encontra no Persona 5 mesmo,  e em certos momentos at\u00e9 pior que no jogo base.

The story was awesome, really fun, though still pretty similar to the typical persona formula, so slightly predictable at times, but still well done and touching. It actually made me cry a couple times on some themes that really hit home for me. The music is dope, as always, and I liked the variety, cause hearing the same one over and over can get old fast. And I think hard mode is well balanced.\nSide Note: this is a sequel, so if you haven't played original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then I highly recommend playing one of those first, or watching someone's playthrough if you don't mind spoilers.

I would NOT recommend this at all if you haven't played the original Persona 5, this builds up directly on top of Persona 5 and you'll feel lost if this is your first Persona game.\n\nI'd give this a 8.5/10, only because Persona 4 and 5 have set a very high standard, so obviously this cannot compete with that but you'll never feel like this was a low-effort cash grab. It's very much a good polished game worth your time and you shouldn't compare it to Persona 5 which had a wayyy longer development time and budget.\n\nWhile there are definitely some weak links, you'll never feel bad about it when you're playing, and I had as much a blast with this game as much as I did with the other main Persona titles. In fact, I actually prefer this action combat system over Persona's original turn-based combat. Any future Persona games using this sort of combat over turn-based combat would be a dream come true (sadly it won't happen but it's fun to think about)\n\nAgain, this is totally worth your money if you've played and liked the original Persona 5. I'm just sad it has ended and I'll have to wait a long time for another high-quality Persona game. I have very specific reasons for not giving it a perfect score but it's not for this review. I feel like there were some game design/level design issues and Sophia is an unlikable character for me personally. But then again, Persona games have always been cheesy, and all those issues won't really bother you when you're playing; they only seem worse in hindsight when you think about them afterwards.\n\nThank you Omega Force, P-Studio and Atlus for making this. I greatly enjoyed my time and now I feel like I'm in a void again now that this has ended.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "63332a9798bb5e1287f7f6178e3be454", "author": "df15a08345dc5617a45ccb495d0bf7c0", "date": "2021-03-29", "hours": 6667, "content": "This game slaps hard, and with the hotfix, I haven't had a single crash.

HOWEVER, it has a very big problem of crashing, sometimes at the worst possible time (I have literally had crashes immediately after finishing a boss fight losing upwards of an hour of progress). I do still recommend the game to anyone wanting to dip their feet into the SMT/Persona series, though it does not only contain spoilers for the base Persona 5 game (takes place not too long after the end of Persona 5) and it also expects you to know the general gist of the plot of Persona 5 as well. Until a patch does come out addressing the stability issues though, I must say to save very frequently to avoid loss of progress. Game length wise is about 40 hours doing most of the side missions/Requests on Normal difficulty so you do get your money's worth, and New Game+ does exist if you feel like rerunning at higher difficulties.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "112b60d1683c5aa5ad0b606d5f0113d7", "author": "10f1a6abb31c5f4a86b36e5ee52ea7e9", "date": "2021-03-28", "hours": 3547, "content": "It's a great sequel of the original game.

As someone who struggles with twitchy games, this one was pretty easy to play.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e72ecbef68ba52cba8d5a59120f88743", "author": "c7836fcb14195a709d5e0a7b9ba8eb09", "date": "2021-03-27", "hours": 3666, "content": "muito insano o jogo tlg?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "84fe0ce970a95314bcd32dd452f3f695", "author": "05918cab753e51e7ba44444ace9846af", "date": "2021-03-27", "hours": 3020, "content": "mash square and occasionally triangle", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2c80b6efec715574a0a7a75913472af9", "author": "4b0e42c1101659f38b8796d5011f50c0", "date": "2021-03-27", "hours": 2462, "content": "I think of all the Personas I've played, this one really helped cement the team, not just as Phantom Thieves, but as actual friends. This one felt so much more personal, like the voice actors had SO MUCH FUN playing these characters and adding their personal touch to it. I especially loved the new characters as well, especially Sophia. She made me tear up multiple times. My favorite team was the P4 Investigation Team, but this game really made me connect the Phantom Thieves so much more. \n\nNow moving to combat, combat feels GOOD. Much better than most other Musou games, as it certainly feels like Atlus/Sega really had their hands in this to feel like a Musou game, but kept the theme and fighting to still feel like a Persona game. All the Thieves had their own showtimes, combat arts, and everyone just felt different in all the right ways. \n\nLastly, the music BUMPS. Persona games have always nailed this, but GOTDAMN this game got the tunes perfect! Every city and the tunes that follow it work for the areas. Everything like coming into the jails, the song playing for the big moments like \"Daredevil\", the title song \"You are Stronger\" Much better than P5 originally, as some palaces didn't really have themes that fit them well. \n\nMy biggest complaint as of now, is the crashing. The game crashes a good amount during some loading screens. Wasn't enough to deter me from playing, since I save almost every time I go to the hideout, before I have to load to the next area, but I was very nervous during some cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, super fun game. I loved every minute of it, and it didn't super overstay its welcome like P5 did. P5R helped manage the time better, and this game, every moment felt impactful and kept me on my toes.\n\n10/10.

Usar diferentes personajes y crear Personas que te ayuden usando los sistemas de debilidades y pasivas a tu favor es muy satisfactorio y han conseguido adaptarlo muy bien a este g\u00e9nero.\n\nIgual es porque vengo de Persona 5 Royal, donde los Mementos ten\u00edan un sistema de configuraci\u00f3n de EXP, dinero y objetos para adaptarlo a tus necesidades, pero aqu\u00ed levelear se vuelve aburrido. Joker es el \u00fanico integrante que no puedes cambiar del grupo, por lo que tienes que ir intercambiando entre 3 personajes y la EXP no se reparte igual a los que est\u00e1n en el grupo como a los que no. Tampoco existe una habilidad que te permita aumentar la EXP recibida, algo que se agradec\u00eda con Mishima en el original.\nTambi\u00e9n porque entrar y salir de combate es m\u00e1s lento aqu\u00ed, y la cantidad de enemigos y la EXP, dineros y objetos que recibes de ellos me hacia sentir que no concordaban las cantidades. Si derroto a 50 enemigos y recibo un trozo de chatarra para vender, siento que no avanzo mucho. Al avanzar la historia conseguir\u00e1s habilidades que mejoren la cantidad de objetos, las Personas y la chatarra tras un combate, pero claro, requiere cierto tiempo.\nA\u00fan con estas pegas, lo considero un juego divertido.\n\nEn cuanto a historia, creo que se parece demasiado a Persona 5 en l\u00edneas generales. Literalmente, muchos puntos coinciden. Pero gracias a Zenkichi (no, no es Dojima 2.0, de verdad) y Sophia se refresca la historia. Zenkichi se come la escena cada vez que sale, tanto por su actor de doblaje como su personalidad. Adem\u00e1s, ver a los protagonistas dar vueltas por Jap\u00f3n, interactuando entre ellos, comiendo, jugando o saliendo por ah\u00ed da mucha vida al juego y lo hacen sentir muy ligero.\nSin duda, lo mejor son ellos, los protagonistas y los lazos que comparten entre ellos. Y si vienes de haber jugado a Persona 5, mucho m\u00e1s. Yo, personalmente, les echaba de menos y ten\u00eda muchas ganas de saber que ser\u00eda de ellos en esta entrega.\n\nY aunque me lo he pasado genial, me he echado unas risas y tiene momentos que no olvidar\u00e9, no tengo ganas de hacer el postgame (que lo hay y bastante). Requiere levelear, farmear mucha cantidad de objetos y dinero.\nHa sido una grata experiencia de 40 horas justas y con eso me voy a quedar.\n\nTambi\u00e9n a\u00f1adir que en la versi\u00f3n actual de PC el juego se ha crasheado un total de 9 VECES. Sobretodo pasa cuando cambias de escenario o de cinem\u00e1tica.\nVale que guardar cuesta 2 segundos de reloj, pero esto tienen que arreglarlo si o si.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "aac5fbaf95f7529b95751eaf8fac4e50", "author": "9b61927ca67f56a8b6b24d45dba2bfbe", "date": "2021-03-27", "hours": 11205, "content": "P5R P5R P5R", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "880bf6cda5485bfeba696c6ff9b1a9a2", "author": "7335e9c3d38852b1b09d679685e0eea9", "date": "2021-03-27", "hours": 4440, "content": "Atlus pls port royal next\n\ngood game though 10/10 if you love persona 5 or persona in general", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d7ae19c6a75e5ced96ecc656951f8d5d", "author": "58c7f293a0ca58df986a654bff77cf04", "date": "2021-03-27", "hours": 1730, "content": "Awesome game!

And Atlus was happy to oblige. And that makes me happy.\n\nThis is probably a horrible place to start of with Persona. Go play P5 if you want to do that, then come back here. Or go play P4 on Steam if you don't have a Playstation. There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this. But if you have played P5, you know why you want to play this, and it will not disappoint.\n\nI'm surprised how well the Persona 5 style was integrated into the hack and slash genre. It really does feel like a Persona game first and a musou game second. Not to mention that it's on Steam and the port is even pretty good! The only other thing I really could ask for is this fitting with Royal better, since this really is a follow-up from P5 and not P5R, but given how Atlus chose to develop both of these games, that wasn't really doable.

Persona 5 Strikers for me was a great game all the way through. When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively.

It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3361af4da8c75acbb4709a7770ce7ba9", "author": "a81bc53e41ca529aace2510831190e74", "date": "2021-03-26", "hours": 8936, "content": "This game makes you feel like a real Phantom Thief all over again", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "00ecc19d9d8c50ea800e4c4f1e48c515", "author": "84c6b9e7a7095829b4cb0cbf81bf986a", "date": "2021-03-26", "hours": 2843, "content": "\u770b\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0d\u8d76\u5feb\u53bb\u4e70\uff1f\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fe3f592b89e05ab99a22f8f63130c0b8", "author": "62cc250070a25716a9989f5c932e80da", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 2384, "content": "Another successful milkage of persona 5 but it is still a fantastic game and I am not even done with the main story.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6ee358dabe2b51139aac0a0b5af7a9bd", "author": "723a21583c8750a289a44ece9e1e3538", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 4377, "content": "Great game.

Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more. And who knows, maybe this game will inspire you to play the other ones for the first time, or the tenth time, and that'd be a pretty great outcome too.\n\nWell done, Atlus.

Only tip I would have is beat Persona 5 (Atlus, PC port PLS) before playing P5 Strikers, this game leans pretty heavily on Persona 5's themes, story and characters, so it can be tough to understand some of the story's depth without it.\n\nPros-\n- Great persona combat systems woven into Dynasty-Warriors style gameplay makes for a completely unique experience. Action-based persona combat is crazy fun.\n- Easy to run - not super demanding but strangely doesn't perform well at native 4K on a 2080ti, but that might be a me thing\n- Classic super deep persona story, shorter but not in a bad way. Easily 40-60 hours for someone experienced in the genres, more if you're not.\n- Plenty of additional challenges like Merciless difficulty on NG+, tougher boss fights and others to keep me coming back for more.\n\nCons-\n- No Ultrawide Support - I can forgive this for Persona 4 golden since it's a port of an older Vita game, but this game is new, come on.\n- Locked to either 30 or 60fps - again, modern games shouldn't have hard FPS caps.\n- Depth of the combat system can make things unforgiving for newer players - allowing for tweaking of individual parts of the game's difficulty like Persona 4 Golden has would go a long way for some players.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "67cf2a378b705a9a88918bf999b61b79", "author": "7474eb321c085e6f8bed140818bb1906", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 2947, "content": "great game, 9/10. would have been a 10 but they still haven't gotten rid of Morgana", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "db6f906fbbbb5268970fcd62bcefdf20", "author": "3733a4b9200759e0afe39d11b13eee96", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 2408, "content": "Give us Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cefd718fa1705b95ab9b884fd46875e1", "author": "17a23200fa605efdb52546e2e9a41d29", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 6556, "content": "N e a t o", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1e0721606c8b56a9b54f5fe00a5906da", "author": "ee832a18d9b053e691ca13a0e5ab6498", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 4058, "content": "Can\u2019t believe they made a game about Joker from smash bros 10/10", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "44d70148800952ae9776501a1aad83dc", "author": "f2dc241bab3e575eb1635cd37c1ed61f", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 143, "content": " \uc81c\ubc1c \ub85c\uc584\uc880 \u3160\u3160", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "96627792d5bc540d8b5a17104b99942d", "author": "59e95911c65152078c1507d9b46b1aa4", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 3700, "content": "Ta bueno, lo platine, muy divertido de jugar, el gameplay es bastante accesible a cualquiera, de hecho, la interfaz es tan grande que hasta un ciego la ver\u00eda.

I also can't recommend that you buy this game unless you have played the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal because it is a direct sequel and it makes no effort to catch the player up to speed.\n\n\nPersona 5 Strikers' new characters (Zenkichi and Sophia) fit seamlessly into the original cast, both of these new additions bring something new to the table, invoking both memorable dialogue and continuities that tie the main story together. The main story of Persona 5 Strikers follows up on Vanilla P5, it takes place during the summer after the main protagonist returns to his hometown and he makes a return to Yongen-Jaya to meet up with his old friends, aiming to do something fun for the summer. Unfortunately, this time of tranquility only lasts for so long until they meet their new conflict, which I'll leave you to discover.\n\nIt's combat is both addicting and intriguing, drawing the player in with immense strategy and its upbeat persona-esque music engaging its player. It's entirely different from P5's turn based combat but retains its strategy in exploiting weaknesses and debuffing your enemies. \n\nThe only problems I have with P5S is that the dungeons sometimes force fights on you, and it's incredibly difficult to manage SP. Also, I think I had somewhere around 4-5 crashes along my playthrough, so it's important to save often. All in all, P5S is a great game and is most definitely worth checking out.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d1519ff682b25b2bb1ea3020485e072b", "author": "c2b9e5d5083857079c6099bfb804389b", "date": "2021-03-25", "hours": 1848, "content": "Although it's been a bit buggy and it Blue Screened my PC the first time I turned it on it really is a fun game!

If so, Persona 5 Strikers is the game for you.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about the Persona series in general, or Persona 5 in particular, to enjoy Strikers. P5S is a musou-style beat-em-up/hack-and-slash free-for-all, so if you've ever played any of the Warriors games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors), you know exactly what this is. That's not to say it's bad; in fact, just the opposite. P5S had me smiling from start to finish because it was simply fun, a thing I had long forgotten video games could be. In a world full of roguelikes, open-world sandboxes, MMORPGs, and JRPGs, the Warriors games simply put you in a room with a hundred bad guys and let you mow them down with manic energy. If that's the sort of thing you find gratifying, you'll like P5S.\n\nThis game is set not too long after the events of Persona 5. The band gets back together for a wild summer tour of Japan, but their plans are interrupted when hearts start changing without any apparent cause. The authorities blame the Phantom Thieves, who are forced to investigate and clear their name. Along the way, they encounter a Lewis Carroll enthusiast, have a classic mix-up in a Japanese hot spring, meet a living AI, bury a cop in sand, nearly get pummeled to death by brainwashed islanders, and fight a giant...um...phallus in a chariot (I'm not even kidding).\n\nIn true Persona style, every fight is a bombastic and flashy beatdown. Whereas other musou games do not penalize direct approaches, P5S rewards you for ambushing enemies and getting in opening hits while traversing dungeons. P5S not only draws on the Warriors franchise for inspiration, but also feels at times like the investigation parts of Ace Attorney and the stealth parts of Metal Gear Solid, while bosses and their dungeons often feel inspired by NiGHTS into Dreams. Using the eponymous personas adds a Pokemon-style RPG element as you swap party members and their personas in and out to maximize attack effectiveness. It's a lot of fun and there's a lot of replay value, especially since the game rewards you for revisiting places you've already been to for additional bonuses. The soundtrack is continuously popping off with jazzy, funky melodies during fights that encourage you to do everything from blow party poppers in your enemies' faces to skateboarding into them at high speed.\n\nIf Strikers is the swan song for Persona 5, then it could not have hit a much higher note. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like the over-the-top antics of any Warriors game and you've been wondering who that one character from Smash Ultimate is, then Persona 5 Strikers will take your heart.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f3cf6e9236ad5c15b2cb19c42ab7442a", "author": "185e4f1bb0695c4e8b525ca4ebe6f32c", "date": "2021-03-24", "hours": 4503, "content": "YES", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "896f9cbd46bd59b3b30aaa4afbfd8670", "author": "b94dbc3456bb556e81c6569d555ded71", "date": "2021-03-24", "hours": 235, "content": "Game constantly hands and locks up during boot up, sever performance issues when the game finally decides to boot up and in game, graphics look muddy and more issues with the game performance and randomly crashing as stated by other users.\n\nSo what would've been an interesting continuation of the story after persona 5 just ends up being frustrating and shows the continued tedium when it comes to atlus, sega and their IP's on PC.

It uses a new hack and slash action RPG combat inspired in part by Musuo games like Dynasty Warriors but is still ostensibly Persona.\n\nGraphics [80/100]:\nThe graphics of Persona 5 Strikers follows the same style of the main entry using the stylized cel shading graphics. These graphics pop and look great.  They ooze style and feel unique.  Strikers is a bit more colorful compared to the original.  The overall package is fantastic and well thought out.  If you liked the style of Persona 5 or anime in general you will enjoy this as it is more of the same.  \n\nBattle System / Combat / Core Gameplay [92/100]:\nThe battle system in Persona 5 Strikers is a massive departure from the original.  It is no longer a turn based JRPG game but now it is an action based hack and slash that uses the ideas from the Persona world. That said, combat is fantastic and fun. It is both fast paced and strategic as you have to abuse the system, as any good Persona game would have you do, to beat the mini bosses and bosses since they have large health pools. The difference is you have to dodge and move and input commands as you go. When it came down to it I found this all very fun and all of the characters have unique and different play styles that made for a fun and challenging game. The game does abandon most of the outside of combat gameplay from the original game which keeps the game moving steady but you do miss social links for sure.\n\n Audio [75/100]:\nThe voice acting and music is good. Voice acting is top notch and everyone nails it in the English dub. The music is also good but lacks some of the best songs from the original. It still has the feels but with the missing songs it doesn\u2019t quite have the same pizzaz that the original brought. I still enjoyed it.  \n\nControls [71/100]:\nControls are responsive for the most part. There is a slight delay whenever you open a menu that you must wait out prior to doing things but it\u2019s easy to become used to that. All the menus are animated so it\u2019s not bad having to wait a second. Characters can feel a bit loose when running but I got used to it quickly enough.\n\nStory [82/100]:\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers follows after the original game and while this story isn\u2019t quite as good it still brings it. We get extended time with the entire crew as we go on a road trip and this is a great experience and I find that this group fits incredibly well with this format. We begin unraveling the metaverse yet again and from there the story unfolds and the intricacies can be found and present themselves very well.\n\nExtras [60/100]:\nThe side quests (requests) are almost entirely go collect something or go kill something. These can be fun since some of the kill quests are pretty challenging and the rewards are good. There are occasional quests to explore parts of the dungeon without porting or getting spotted and these are different and fun as well.  As a whole though the side quests offer little story or interesting add ons outside of challenge and good rewards. \n\nOverall [87/100]:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a fantastic game that has a combat system that is fun and engaging while being simple and flashy as well. The story is good and interesting and the characters are still as fantastic as ever. If you are a fan of Persona 5 this is a must play. For others as this is a direct sequel I would recommend Persona 5 first then this. If you didn\u2019t like Persona 5 this plays so differently that you may still like it as long as it wasn\u2019t the aesthetics that you didn\u2019t enjoy.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2fa282ef4cd05c76883d6405ad5c1b4f", "author": "f54f2e73738e5d2da7114ea438463334", "date": "2021-03-24", "hours": 3161, "content": "ryuji is stupid and hot. very nice.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5dfe8f6ac00357d5af016a6ad54d83e7", "author": "6d5245ac908b5ceb91aa9eaa1a580db0", "date": "2021-03-24", "hours": 2804, "content": "Hee-Ho?", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "69d1183d0b7754c9b378f8d9315f4bc4", "author": "f95824d9fbd45623b7b8366787eafacf", "date": "2021-03-24", "hours": 4215, "content": "Just beat the same boss 8 times because of a bug that wouldn't allow me to progress through a loading screen after the fight :)", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "681a905805475553957401fc984ec792", "author": "c0d37154af3853d5a612048f74729877", "date": "2021-03-24", "hours": 2032, "content": "Que juegazo man! Totalmente recomendado seas o no fan de la saga PERSONA.

El juego tiene una duraci\u00f3n entre 25-50 horas, dependiendo de c\u00f3mo te lleves el juego, en mi caso, 34 horas por todo lo principal + una que otra cosilla secundaria interesante (Muchas misiones secundarias son de relleno, otras muy buenas que te aportan buen lore de personajes y merecen la pena, pero bueno, como en todos los juegos es as\u00ed) Totalmente recomendado, lo \u00fanico a mejorar para la pr\u00f3xima es el tema de c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n hechas las \"mazmorras\" (no dir\u00e9 nombre, para evitar spoiler) la cual se siente un poco repetitiva la construcci\u00f3n de estas.

[/h1]\n\n[b] Fair Warning [/b]: My playtime does not reflect the length of this game, and I have not finished it due to being utterly frustrated with my aforementioned issues.\n\nWhen this got announced for PC, I was pretty excited to get some more breadcrumbs of Persona on the platform, even if it were just a Warriors-style spinoff. However, the final product given has left a LOT to be desired.\n\nThe first thing you may notice, at least if you have the game installed on an SSD, is the straight up abysmal bootup and loading times. Like, at least couple MINUTES to load into the intro screens. This game is definitely not as demanding as the original P5, and that game takes no effort to load on a disk drive for a console that's already out the door. On top of that, the game will constantly freeze and crash on loading screens. I've had 4 crashes in 24 hours, and 2 of those came on the same exact loading screen. The devs, however, do have a beta branch out as of this writing in the hopes of diagnosing and fixing these crashes.\n\nThe second thing you may notice, is how the writing in this release is just straight up not good. Some characters fall further into their awful stereotypes set in the original game (Ryuji & Ann are Dumb & Dumber, Makoto is even more bland, etc.). The two new characters to the group are just straight up depth-less copies of previous Persona franchise characters ( [spoiler] Sophia is super cute but seems to have the same character conflict as Aigis from P3, and Zenkichi has an eerily similar backstory and conflict as Dojima from P4 [/spoiler] ). There's even a bathhouse scene taken straight from Persona 3, except with the interesting bits removed and replaced with a generic slapstick punchline. Some positives to point out, though: the slice-of-life moments in this game feels just as heartwarming as the original game, Morgana is much less annoying, and Haru has way much more character and plays a bigger role in this game than she ever did before.\n\nThe third thing you may notice, the battle gameplay in this game feels confusing at first, but actually feels really clean and satisfying once you grasp it! However that quickly goes away once you realize the gameplay is just: travel to this place, battle a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, defend Futaba against a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, battle a boss and a crowd of enemies to complete part of the level. Repeat about three times and that's an entire arc of this game in the simplest terms possible. The battle gameplay is honestly not that frustrating (except: [spoiler] the massively disappointing Shadow Joker boss battle with an outrageous change in normal gameplay that honestly feels like a dumb gimmick rather than a difficulty spike [/spoiler]). If you enjoy Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, you probably won't have any problems here.\n\nAll in all, this is a ridiculously disappointing game. It's clunky/broken at times, cringey even for Persona standards, and just boring, confusing, and frustrating overall. At least the game's performance problems are in the process of being fixed.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 4, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b87dff19fc92515d8f9da231c36bb308", "author": "c52bc6e7a75c5b02a291f46950d33378", "date": "2021-03-23", "hours": 6080, "content": "Like everyone is saying.

The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2,

The art direction is, as usual for the Persona 5 games, absolutely gorgeous with somehow even MORE stylish menu designs that incorporate the other members of the phantom thieves. \n\nThe level design, while linear, is pretty par for the course when it comes to a \"Warriors\" game, with large, linear maps that offer decent amounts of challenge. But this is where Strikers diverges from the usual formula, as the team behind the game has put a lot of effort into blending the gameplay style of the warriors games with the RPG elements of Persona 5, as instead of a single instanced map with objectives to defend, Strikers instead opts to thrust players into a large dungeon-like map with multiple instanced rooms, each filled with roaming symbol encounters that will drop the player into a small-scale \"1 v 100\" battle.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Persona 5 Strikers to pretty much anyone, be they fans of Persona, Dynasty Warriors-Style Games, or even neither of those.

This is Persona 5 - 2. Despite the change in gameplay style it's really just a follow up to P5 in both story and scope. It's a great excuse to have some more fun with the lovable cast of P5 this time on PC. Honestly, Despite what was said by the devs, I don't think this is too much fun for most people who haven't played the original P5 or Royal. Consider playing P5 before this to really get the most out of it. PS3's are pretty cheap nowadays, and if not it's pretty stable on RPCS3 *wink*. If you've played P5, It's an easy 10/10. If not please play P5 and then come here. If there's really no way for you to play P5 then maybe hold out for a sale cause the combat's still fun but honestly this game is more fun if you already love the cast. It goes down to like a 6/10 if you don't know the cast and past events. It doesn't spoil anything from P5 too big and you can still switch up the order but it's not recommended.\nUnlike this game.

Characters are consistent with their portrayals in base p5, though it stands to note that this game follows a story where persona 5 royal never happened. This game absolutely lives up to the legacy of the series, and the new characters I really enjoyed. Music was incredible, definitely enough to stand on its own. Setting was incredible. Plot progression was incredible. If anything at all, I feel like the writing in this game did feel a little on the nose and cheesy at times, but not at all enough to affect my overall opinion.\n\n[h1]SPOILERS [/h1]\n[spoiler]The final boss was easy. Like, really easy. Throughout my entire playthrough, I pretty much exclusively stuck with Joker (for obvious reasons), Haru (for heat riser and the fact that killing enemies with her rocket launcher was funny), Sophia (because she had a great moveset), and Yusuke (though I switched him out with Zenkichi during the Kyoto jail). While they were hovering in the mid level 70s by the final boss, my other team members ended under level 60. When you had to split up and fight the meatballs on the towers, I had no trouble spamming their moves and made it out without a single person dying. Even when you get all the meatballs and Joker has to kill EMMA, I just spammed Maeigaon and killed it without taking any damage. Honestly the Archangel in the room right before EMMA was more challenging in my opinion. The hardest boss of the entire game was Shadow Joker, and that's only because you do such little damage to him. I only got out of that boss fight by spamming health and sp healing items and wailing on him for a solid 10 minutes. Finally, I want to bring attention to Zenkichi. He absolutely stole the show in the entire game. There was so much passion that went into his performance, and, when paired with the writing of his character, made him the best part of the entire game. Also, as a temporary musical nerd, seeing Valjean appear in the awakening scene was an out of body popoff experience. The portrayal of Valjean as a persona was perfect (it even had the 24601 on his chest). But seeing Valjean specifically as the persona of Zenkichi was the most incredible thing because Valjean fits so perfectly with Zenkichi's character. AND it drew the parallel of Akane being Zenkichi's Claudette like oh my god that was absolutely genius.[/spoiler]\n\nHonestly, it's astounding to me what they were able to accomplish with this game, and it absolutely gave me the same feeling of unending emptiness of the mainline persona games when it ended (which is crazy because no social links and also half the playtime wow).", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b3618ae286265440818986e618069df8", "author": "4ff97406574d5e378bb576ea57fce649", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 3748, "content": "This is my first game from the Persona-series. I have watched a bit of Persona 5, but that was it. I also haven't watched any content to P5Strikers, or better, P5Scramble. This is why I was surprised that it was a Hack-n-slash game, however, it works really well with the setting. And the story, oh boy, good characters, good plot and overall a great experience. Every character has its onw playstyle, be it the allrounder Joker who has really save moves, Ryuji who has massive burst-options that leave him wide open for attacks or Makoto or Morgana who specialize in buffing and healing their teammates. If you like the Persone-style and look for a good hack-n-slash, play this, it's like a 40-hour game and worth every single cent. The only downside to this game is its instability, it sometime crashes, not often, but often enough for you to start saving all the time, however, you can't save during cutscenes or textboxes, you have to wait till cutscenes are over and just pray. If there is a hot-fix, ill give it a perfect score of 10/10, but till now it is a 9.5/10.\nMusic is, as expected from the Persona-games, great.

However, with the new beta patch applied, those issues seem to be resolved and I have had a crash free experience! So make sure you opt into the beta up until the patch goes live properly. \n\nAlso, this game does use Denuvo Anti-Temper, which is controversial for many reasons including proven performance impacts as seen by games that have had the middleware removed. Some people very much dislike Denuvo, so it's only fair to make sure you're aware that is is there in case that is something that would impact your purchase. In that case, you may wish to consider either not purchasing the game, or seeking out its PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch ports if you own those systems.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can talk about how I actually feel about the game itself.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a spin off of...Persona 5, funnily enough. It's by Koei Tecmo, the developers of the Warriors games. I personally am not a fan of those games, so I was pretty relieved when I found that Strikers is actually not a Warriors game. While it shares some of the base components e.g. controlling a party of heroes fighting large groups of enemies, the similarities pretty much end there.\n\nIn terms of combat, the game is a lot more focused on keeping your party alive, managing your HP/SP, and taking advantage of your enemies' weaknesses to gain control over the battle. In that regard, those tactical elements make the game feel strangely a lot like a Persona game in execution even with the change to real time action combat. Like many of the other Persona games, you also visit the Velvet Room to acquire and fuse new Personas throughout the game to give you more powerful tools to deal with the enemies. Social links are not in this game, but are replaced with a 'bond' system where you gain points to spend on upgrades for your party by interacting with them, cooking new recipes, and completing requests.\n\nThe ways these mechanics compliment each other help to make this feel a lot different from other spin offs and make it feel much more like a companion to the main Persona games rather than just another cash grab. Added to this, this isn't another dancing game, or non-canon 'it was all a dream' type spin off, but an actual direct sequel to Persona 5. However, this does mean that the game will spoil the events of Persona 5.  This makes this game kind of a strange choice to release considering that game is not on PC, but it was likely easier to port a game that was already in active development. \n\nIf you have only played the original Persona 5, you will not be spoiled for the events of Royal as this game started development before Royal. Atlus likely also did not share any of the new plot elements of the re-release with Koei Tecmo, so Royal is not referenced at all in this game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game much if you're a newcomer to the series, but if you are a Persona fan that enjoyed the hell out of 5, this feels pretty much like more Persona 5. In terms of story, it does retread some elements from the previous game and lift some elements into the new story and many of the 'twists' of the game's story are pretty easy to see coming. If you've played other Persona games, or are just generally familiar with the tropes of these types of games, you'll see where the story is going pretty easily. That being said, it is still a well executed and enjoyable story even if predictable.\n\nLastly...the music. Yeah. This a Persona game. It's got pretty great music.\n\nWhy are you still reading this and not playing Persona 5 Strikers?!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "307d97bd66da5faea7c3ed05fbc4000b", "author": "690ca6d788435c5095762984d566acd6", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 301, "content": "I HAVE THIS GAME", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8b9d96b0dcf25a208109c51e5f8cdf55", "author": "b9016825ddad58e7b4385e44d345322f", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 1500, "content": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u53d1\u8bc4\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u662f\u5751\u7239\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4\u4e0d\u503c\u56db\u767e\u4e94\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0d\u8981\u5982\u624b\u6b63\u3002\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u6b7b\u4e86\u5417\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u95ea\u9000\u5361\u987f\u51e0\u4e4e\u4f34\u7740\u6211\u8fd9\u5341\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d70\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5c31\u5f53\u82b1\u94b1\u4e70\u6559\u8bad\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c0fe0c76631e5266b333a9cd042299a4", "author": "0f109971b1c852cd8fb292c272eb8619", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 1658, "content": "Biggest complaint is that its not a sequel to royal, one of the biggest villain in the game feels abit too similar to the final villain in royal and other too familiar if not copy paste to the villan at the end of base persona 5, and no mention of kasumi is quite jaring especially when i completed royal a few months back.\n\nIf you look past that though, uve got a great adventure with the phantom thieves plus 2 newcommers, as well as a dystansty warrors x persona fighting system that while flashy, is addictive and fun, and the soundtrack is a great mix of personas 5s, its a must play for those who love the phatom thieves, now we just need royal on steam, persona 5 base at the least.\n\nSide note, worst thing is my teacher doesn't remember our intimate relationship so minus rep for that one.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "12fa4549bfe85a10afe971bd08cc4792", "author": "3964166018df559aa7e6777eb6f00c2c", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 2623, "content": "Persona 5: 2", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1e184e06f38b580689551c793db00121", "author": "551d18a88ec954cba5610465f416bab5", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 4935, "content": "Gameplay is amazing and music is somehow even better.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "40ee7bec0af25530a3f520da3680605e", "author": "ef2a90bc25055b839d45b2e9e3ee4c74", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 5460, "content": "For his neutral Special, he wields a gun\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "aa460c08c1915a0589540bbddc991420", "author": "0987b664615658839b5d8bc7ef962e82", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 1482, "content": "atlus love the ports keep em coming.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "428c0089a27654aca65aec5da4ab848f", "author": "bfbee58beca0521993ef312c465f927d", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 14229, "content": "Background: I went into this game very excited to play it but didn\u2019t expect the game to be in my favorite games of all time.

Graphics for the game even on the max graphics settings are OK at best. The models in persona 5 are so much more crisp while the models in persona 5 strikers are blurry and hard to look at when far away. After playing persona 5, I have to admit that the characters have gotten stale for me. All of the arcs that the characters went through in persona 5 are pretty much just reused in this game, making it seem very lazy to say the least. A character that really grinds my gears is Sophia. Her character development is pretty much a sh*tty version of a certain someones character development in persona 3. No social links is also a real bummer. It was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed persona 5 and without them the game really feels like its missing something. Another thing I would like to point out is the fact that they make you go back into the real world and sit through two loading screens just to recover your SP. And its not like there's any incentive to go back to the real world. There's no social links, the day doesn't change, and the area your in remains exactly the same until you manage to drag yourself through the jail. Every time you try to do a persona attack it freezes time disrupting any natural flow the game could have had. As for the soundtrack, there's a few soundtracks I like and a few that are pretty terrible. The soundtrack I found most enjoyable was the soundtrack to the first jail, Love te Wonderland. Otherwise, it mostly goes downhill from there. Overall, the games not terrible and may be enjoyable to fans of the hack and slash genre, but to everyone else I wouldn't recommend it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5df23488ac345344939becf51a8c332b", "author": "53cdc127af7259f8ae71c43ceaeb9cfa", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 1965, "content": "\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294\ub370 \ud6c4\ubc18\ubd80 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uba74 \ubb34\uc870\uac74 \ud504\ub9ac\uc9d5 \uac78\ub9ac\ub2c8\uae4c \n10\ubd84\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uc138\uc694^_^...\uc2dc\ubc23", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0bdb4713d4da5cbd88b372208923ebe0", "author": "d4d061d459265a628bfbe8b67fa524ee", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 3009, "content": "Its a must for persona fans because you get to slash shadows around with your peeps.

Al contrario de lo que me esperaba, se siente como un ARPG de Persona mas que un juego generico de Warriors reskineado. La jugabilidad es excelente, cada personaje se siente diferente en jugabilidad al otro, las dungeons son bastante entretenidas y el sistema de combate es casi cat\u00e1rtico. Me sorprendi\u00f3 lo bien que se tradujo la jugabilidad de P5 a este juego, teniendo una importancia fundamental la explotaci\u00f3n de las debilidades, cr\u00edticos y t\u00e9cnicos, suponiendo literalmente la vida o muerte. Relacionado a esto, el juego tiene una dificultad que castiga demasiado, que hace que no sea demasiado dificil si dominas el estilo de combate del personaje que usas y haces una estrategia acorde al enemigo enfrente tuyo, pero que te destruye en el momento en el que te distra\u00e9s. \nLa banda sonora es excelente (generalmente al nivel del juego original, y teniendo varios remixes que le pasan el palo a las canciones originales), aunque algunas canciones de dungeon se sienten extremadamente gen\u00e9ricas (despues de la 4ta dungeon en adelante esto deja de pasar, teniendo temas bastante memorables). \nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico al principio me tra\u00eda dudas, ya que zonas que son comparables con P5 como puede ser Shibuya no se ven mal pero se ven distintas, aunque en el momento en el que dej\u00e1s de comparar el apartado gr\u00e1fico con el juego original, Strikers empieza a brillar por su cuenta, teniendo generalmente un estilo gr\u00e1fico bastante distintivo y que sabe adaptar perfectamente el estilo gr\u00e1fico del juego original. \nEn cuanto a la performance, no not\u00e9 nada malo mas all\u00e1 de un crasheo a las 20hs de juego (que mucha gente parece tener), pero el antialasing de este juego DESTRUYE la UI, dandole un aspecto a la fuente del juego como si estuviera a 144p.\nLa historia del juego est\u00e1 completamente a la altura, manteniendo las personalidades originales del cast del juego sin reducirlas a dos caracteristicas ridiculas e infumables (cosa de la que suelen pecar MUCHISIMO los spin-offs de la saga Persona), y la trama es generalmente buena, dejandole tiempo a la mayor\u00eda del cast para que pueda brillar por su cuenta (aunque ven venir todos y cada uno de los giros argumentales del juego desde 4 kilometros a la redonda). Me encantaron todos los personajes agregados, y se siente que tienen un buen desarrollo que les permite brillar. \n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, si te gusta Persona 5 y los ARPG, posiblemente te encante este spin-off/secuela/loquesea, pero si no te jugaste/viste/leiste P5 no te lo puedo recomendar. No vas a entender absolutamente nada, y el juego no se sienta a explicar los conceptos principales que ya se tocaron en el juego original (lo cual me parece excelente, porque si me explican una vez mas lo que es un palacio voy a hacer una masacre). \n\n8/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3b346e9b351156ab83d82a29d22b043c", "author": "2c187706a669558c9bcefd815eed030a", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 4261, "content": "Nunca voy a olvidar las 17 horas que pase farmeando a metatron para conseguir el ultimo trofeo de mierda, juegazo.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dd907787b7ef5723a05052424bdf76a1", "author": "23027ed0d6185cc4864aac56bacff76c", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 9575, "content": "video game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f4c28770f9765019937328fddf553594", "author": "b0c6ed6757ec55d0ad39893f945944d9", "date": "2021-03-21", "hours": 207, "content": "I wasn't sure if I want to pick yes or no but decided to go with no, since I had a kinda hard time really enjoying it.

If you don't like the gameplay of other warriors games then you probably wont enjoy this one, though if you want more of the P5 cast and story then i can still recommend playing on easy mode and it may surprise you.\n\nI can make that recommendation since this is one of the best warriors style games out there. All of the characters are fun to play and the combat is so satisfying, it tones down a lot of the warriors series main features to allow for the new content but that rounds off the experience really well to make for a game thats just fun to play.\n\nTLDR\n\nIf you liked the base P5 or are a fan of good warriors games then give this a go.

El nivel es m\u00e1s bajo, desde luego, pero es entretenida e interesante, aunque bastante m\u00e1s predecible tambi\u00e9n. Hay sistema de equipamiento, no hay social links (natural, se supone que ya han tenido lugar en el transcurso de su precuela) pero hay un sistema poco m\u00e1s o menos equivalente pero con progreso com\u00fan para todo el grupo. La dificultad est\u00e1 bien ajustada, con el nivel m\u00e1s alto solo disponible al terminar el juego (l\u00f3gico, porque los enemigos empiezan a nivel 70, ser\u00eda inviable empezar en estas condiciones por muy h\u00e1bil que sea el jugador), est\u00e1 bien para dar otra vuelta y terminar los logros que queden pendientes.\n\nSi no has jugado P5... aparte de los spoilers enormes que vas a comerte, pienso que se pierde mucha de la gracia de este juego, que es el \"fanservice SFW\" de ver muchos personajes a los que tienes cari\u00f1o otra vez, en una aventura con un poco de miga.\n\nLa banda sonora, una chulada. Remixes de canciones de P5, con alguna incorporaci\u00f3n nueva de la mano de Lotus Juice y Lyn Inaizumi. Una pena que el juego de baile no haya salido despu\u00e9s de este t\u00edtulo, se pierden varios temas muy curiosos.\n\nLa traducci\u00f3n al castellano no est\u00e1 mal. Con alg\u00fan gazapo inexplicable aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1, pero no es lo peor que he visto, y el juego tiene bastante texto. Las voces est\u00e1n disponibles en ingl\u00e9s y japon\u00e9s, y se puede cambiar en cualquier momento.\n\nEdito: Sobre los cuelgues, s\u00ed, he tenido alg\u00fan crasheo, en torno a 5-6 en 60 horas de juego que me parece... bastante, la verdad. Me alegra ver que los desarrolladores est\u00e1n en ello, de hecho hay una beta a fecha de marzo de 2020 (consultar los foros, es abierta) y desde que la he instalado no he tenido ning\u00fan cuelgue en las \u00faltimas 10h, aunque por lo que dicen a\u00fan puede pasar, aunque bastante menos.

Once I started playing, I'll admit a part of me wasn't totally sold on the concept as a whole yet. I had never played a Musuo/Dynasty Warriors game before but knew that I had to see what the next chapter for the Phantom Thieves had in store for us. Sure enough, the further I progressed, the more the game grew on me and the more I bought into the transition Persona 5 went through to become a game like this. In reality, the essence of what makes Persona 5 such a compelling and lovable game was really what shined through in the end. The cast was full of life, love, fantastic personalities and unforgettable moments. Every character had moments that really let them take center stage and remind us all of what it means to overcome our own struggles and once again stand up on our own two feet. Personally, I wan't to give a special shout out to Haru, who was the final character to join the team in Persona 5. One of the things I wished we had in P5 was more time to spend with Haru and more opportunities for her to shine and that is exactly was Strikers gives us. This goes for all characters as well. I enjoyed getting to tag along with the Phantom Thieves for another journey through the human heart that resulted in some strong and powerful character moments that empowered the story to really hit home for myself and I'm sure for plenty of people, especially after everything we've been through and are still going through with COVID. It's crazy to think how towards the beginning of the pandemic we were graced with Persona 5 Royal and now a year later, we're given a worthwhile next chapter for the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. A few things to touch on before wrapping this up.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nThe entire Persona series is known for its exceptional soundtracks and Strikers is no slouch in that department. Whether its the remixes of classic P5 tunes or the newcomers to the party making you stop what you're doing and groove in your chair, this game has no shortage of tunes for all manor of situations to aid you in your Phantom Thief duties! I plan on adding this soundtrack to my collection of Persona tunes that I already listen to on a daily basis.\n\n[h1] Crashes [/h1]\nThroughout my roughly 45 hours of game time, I had 3 total crashes happen while playing on PC. Thankfully, none of these crashes happened at crucial moments but it is something I've seen people write about in other reviews so make sure to save as often as possible!\n\n[h1] Story Continuation from Persona 5 [/h1]\nWhile ultimately not super important for the overall story, this game definitely assumes that you have played P5 before and are familiar with it's story so be mindful if you haven't played P5 before and are considering getting this game!\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nAny opportunity to team back up with the Phantom Thieves is easily one worth taking and Strikers does a great job delivering on a worthy sequel to what was already my favorite game of all time. Hopefully the overwhelming amount of positive feedback will encourage Atlus to keep releasing Persona games on steam since its clear that the Phandom, old and new, are eager for more! P5 fans will adore this game but ultimately, any fans of good storytelling and meaningful character development will fall in love just as easily!

If you haven't yet, definitely do so, it's an excellent follow-up.\n\nThe story, characters, Persona Fusing, weakness-exploiting, all of it feels like an excellent continuation from Persona 5, just wapped up in an Action Game format instead of a turn-based JRPG, while ALSO giving you ways to pause the action (summoning personas and pulling out the guns) to assess the situation and respond thoughtfully.\n\nDespite the marketing and the combo system, this is NOT a Warriors/Musou game.  It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.  There's very little unlocking required to access your core essential abilities and you can start doing cool and awesome stuff from the word go.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eb3be6c72fe85945978ea5ebf6bdad29", "author": "2f7f3fec2e5650d280be9210f5320c29", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 2931, "content": "Good Sequel :)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c6778efaa8335c9099d276fa92494b4b", "author": "2dd61e5d945b5b6480a3fd8e1e2c6c60", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 984, "content": "It's amazing in all levels, but i just couldn't continue with the hellscape of loading screens, many of the dialogues, and the insane repetition of the jails.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7143acef6a8c52f9968879d3abfd0e0e", "author": "a4a113757fc0544ca9081155eec847ca", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 3639, "content": "worthy follow up to Persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "99acd04c74135c9abcec0389fdf4160b", "author": "d1df6fa317715a55b724ba56639f34aa", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 5195, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the 2nd Persona game to make it onto the Steam store and is the sequel to Persona 5.  It brings with it a compelling story, engaging combat and amazing music.  While technically a musou game, the game plays very much like a Persona game in most respects.  The majority of this review compares the differences between this game and Persona 5 and Musou games to give you a good sense of what you are getting yourself into.  \n\n[h1] Whats Changed [/h1]\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nCombat is by far the biggest difference between Persona 5 in this game.  The Combat has changed from a Turn Based System to an Active Time System, though it executes this spectacularly.  All of the iconic features of Persona are still present in this new combat system such as Weakness exploitation, All Out Attacks, and Stat/Ailment effects.  You also initiate combat just like you would in any other Persona game, by attacking an enemy on the field which sends you into a real time battle on the map.  \n\nWhile this is labeled as a Musou game, the only thing it really has in common with them is the number of enemies present on the screen usually consisting of a large number of trash mobs and a few enemies that actually pose a threat.  In addition, since it is Real Time, enemy attacks are now telegraphed and nearly all attacks are preventable by dodging out of the way or interrupting the enemy.  While this might be a bit hard to execute in trash mob fights with tons of enemies, this really shines in boss fights where there is one major threat to focus on.  \n\nOverall, this new Combat System is intertwined excellently with the Persona series, making you wonder why they have never done this before.  \n\n[b] Confidant System [/b]\n\nThe next big difference between this game and Persona 5 is the Confidant System, which was replaced with Bond Levels.  Unfortunately, this new system is quite limited as a whole, as it comprises only of party member interaction and lacks any NPCs to interact with and gain confidant levels with.  In addition, the time management system is all but gone as a result.  However, this new system still allows you to gain the benefits of the Confidant System by giving you Bond Exp with interactions, which you can use to buy perks very similar to what you would gain from Confidants.  \n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n \n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThe story is compelling as ever and while not quite as good as the main Persona series, still holds its own quite well, especially for a Musou game which typically don't have great stories. \n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nThe Music remains a strong point of the game and the series as a whole, with a number of remixed pieces from Persona 5 as well as plenty of new additions.  \n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\n[b] Crashes [/b]\n\nIn 50 hours of this game, I've had the game crash 5 times.  Each of these crashes occurred at either entering or exiting a dungeon, so often not much progress was lost.  However, since this game does not auto save, you have to be careful to save often to prevent losing significant progress.  \n\n[b] Lack of Prequel Explanation [/b] \n\nThis game absolutely expects you to have played Persona 5 prior to playing this game, as there is little explanation of character's backstories or prior events.  Often times, the game references major plot points of the previous game but does nothing to even mention what happened, leaving people who haven't played the previous game confused.  While normally not too much of a problem, it is not even possible to play Persona 5 on Steam as of this review.  \n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is an extremely strong spinoff of Persona 5 with compelling gameplay and story.  However, it lacks some of the major features that some Persona fans love so much and also requires you to have played the first game in order to properly enjoy the story.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7fa63bfcef5858aca04f9829bc32bd20", "author": "30d9e48cb41556d488364ab74da01629", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 7363, "content": "a very good sequel to even better game ( PERSONA 5 ), not the Royal.\nit's a sequel, so I don't recommend anyone to play it before playing P5 or watching it or whatever.

When I first listened that we were going to have a new Persona experience with a new battle system which replace the turn based combat, it was really exciting news, but I also thought that it was going to be just a musou/warriors game with a persona art style, and hoo boy how I was wrong about that assumption.\n From the music to the art style,  and to the story and the combat, it really felt like a Persona 5 game. The implementation of some of the previous games combat system mechanics to this new musou/warriors style combat fitted perfectly. Each of the phantom thieves combat skills are unique and different from each other. About the music, they never cease to amaze me. Each of the music tracks are phenomenal and outstanding. If they release a Persona 5 Farming Simulation game with new music like this and the previous games, I\u00b4ll keep giving them my money.\n The visual novel story part is still in this game and very well adapted, and although the social link aspect of the previous game is replaced with this new bond level system, I think it adapts really well to the format of this game. The story and new characters in my opinion are very well written, and it is really easy to attach to them, as usual.\n If I had to criticize something, perhaps it would be that some of the characters from the previous game are not in this one, either way, the main roaster is here. \nTo conclude, if you have previously played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, definitely you have to play this game without any doubt. I repeat, if you have not played those games, then go play them first. THIS IS A SEQUEL.

It feels super bad to play, especially if you are trying to do the constant backtracking side missions which just require you grind X enemy in Y dungeon Z times.\n\nAgain from the original game, abilities use HP/SP but unlike the original game there isnt a ticking clock that makes you want to get as far through the palace as possible in one go. In strikers you can leave the dungeon at any checkpoint (which are very common) and instantly return with full stats. So unless you like fighting health spongey bosses with no stats youl be jumping in and out of dungeons often early on when you dont have many tools/items.\n\nTonnes of the game (especially the shibuya areas) feel fake, the attention to detail and things you can do are significantly limited, while this is understandable it just makes it feel strange to have 7 different shops next to each other that all sell 2 things when you have no real reason to actually touch them at all outside the cooking mechanic (which isnt a mechanic as much as a way to make a shitload of items quickly, if you bought ingredients earlier)\n\nIn the end the game just feels like the people making it liked persona 5 (and probably previous SMT games) but didnt really like the downtime aspects of persona 5, or had no idea how to implement it with the road trip aesthetic.\n\nI really wish it was just a lazy Persona 5 Warriors game, because im having fun in extremely quick bursts followed by worse handholding than original p5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ecec3622d3e65b18a75e23e69892d6ed", "author": "ee8cd8f5de105f919428d12c9e6a05f5", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 2830, "content": "Great game if you played Persona 5, but otherwise I don't recommend it.

The difficulty Is pretty well done in the early stages but as you proceed it gets way too easy at the point where you could mash 2 buttons to win easily even at the highest difficulty. positives were the music remix were so good ngl.

It continues the story of P5 in a similar, yet new way and continues to build the characters of P5.\n\nI found the gameplay very enjoyable, with it's unconventional turn-based RPG mechanics mixed in with the action gameplay. The action felt just right, you're able to dash around and attack just like in devil may cry but at the push of a button every stops and it becomes much more like a turn based rpg.\nI don't think they could have implemented this much better, so kudos.\n\nJust like the original the soundtrack is great. I personally prefer it to the original P5, but this is just my style of music. They even added in some Remixes of the original games music.\n\nLastly the story. I find it very good. It has been streamlined with story progression now being tied to your in-game progression, since there is no calendar system. I'm sure it would have been nice to see all characters from P5 return, but think it's better this way. The new additions fit in well too (mostly).\nThe real crime with the story of this game is a PC and switch exclusive problem. The original games aren't on these platforms and therefore many people are most likely going to be out of the loop when starting the game. Therefore they may miss some of the more subtle things, not understand everything or just not care. \n\nIn terms of the port, I did not have any big issues. Some framedrops when things got heated. I did have a few crashes, but only about six or seven in 70+ hours of playtime. Sidenote: This was also within the first two weeks of the games release. I have not tried 1.02 but I assume that is even better. \n\nOverall I recommend this game. It's really great. My biggest issue with it is that the NG+ difficulty might as well be called BS mode, so yeah. Great game. Worth your money.\n...\nBut there's a catch.\nI recommend you at least have basic knowledge of the previous game. I got through just fine knowing the base plot of the P5 and having watched the anime(yes the anime does cover most of the important things). Let's just hope that Atlus do eventually port Persona 5 (Royal) to PC, but I think it's basically a given at this point. :)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bc2a159948d45947a9ebd4c9ac9f96d6", "author": "64536dfc8039521e8ef7bcc2da57d5f1", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 2866, "content": "prank 'em ryuji", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "233daa2b317b50f184c54643263d5431", "author": "12b32e83d58e529790f84e2f4af9b1ad", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 3271, "content": "best game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2ed7d391bbc25b62a3d2010442f4d7ef", "author": "5b1c3be9738351af85823e8719e9ff7c", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 6728, "content": "\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 100 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e p5 royal \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043a)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a8d0741b37985b5fbc8eb2a237c2828d", "author": "2d6c1027ae325349b1e77bddc1f6716a", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 2384, "content": "\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e22 atlus \u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e04\u0e22 \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e1c\u0e34\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e502206639cc589a9fa76e571aa5b6cc", "author": "3d2edd1d8072523cacc05986380fdde8", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 3914, "content": "[b] Pros: [/b] \n- Continues the story from Persona 5, with new themes.

Luckily I never was hit with it or any other major bugs. I think in my opinion Atlus did a great job with the release of Persona 5 Strikers on Steam.\n\nI 100%'d Persona 4 Golden a little before this came out early.

I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b1c1cd50875f5c70aa30f107a41ecb71", "author": "ef57458537285c6b894e71cecaab43c0", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 3347, "content": "i haven't had this much fun with a game in a long time\n\ni was skeptical about the game when it was first announced - it seemed flashy and energetic, but i wasnt sure how the game could marry musou combat and a megaten fusion/affinity system together\nbut i was wrong lol\ngameplay is exciting and oozes the persona 5 flourish, while never feeling too visually overwhelming\ni was surprised to find that the general musou focus on slaughtering thousands of enemies isn't super potent here - there are moments of cathartic release where you can wail on waves and waves of shadows, but strikers does a great job of giving you more complex fights with interesting minibosses\neach fighter has something interesting to offer mechanically, which makes it more fun to switch out your party members - even characters i dont like as written are fun to mess around with in dungeons\nthe game isn't incredibly strong narratively, but there are plenty of good character moments over the course of the story to keep you invested - though some may be predictable to those already familiar with neo-persona\nthe new music tracks fit the game well, and the dlc legacy music pack is a welcome addition. getting the innocent sin music to play during fights pumps dopamine directly into my brainstem\n\nthe camera can sometimes be a bit of a pain - not enough to knock points, but something to note\nit's most notable in certain boss fights, where the enemy is moving very quickly around the stage and the camera has a hard time following them around if you're trying to lock on\nsome enemies are also a bit spongier than they really need to be - certain bosses make sense, but some fights feel like they go on longer than they deserve to, and become less a test of skill and more a test of endurance\n\nthat said it's an incredibly solid game\ni hope this pc port sells well - i'd love to see atlus be more willing to port their games over to more platforms\nplenty of games like digital devil saga 1&2, the persona 2 duology, and especially ronde deserve to be experienced by a modern audience", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "559e81486b13567795b7016d8aa7a8e1", "author": "d7eefeb7dfed5f3290c28e91647fd6e3", "date": "2021-03-20", "hours": 2604, "content": "Actually crying rn......

to breath, 60h for me (grinding and side quest stuff) and nearly 100% it. \n\ni only have 3 Contras:\n - Persona fusion is different, you have a free option which personas to fuse, but for specific requests you are \"forced\" to use 2 specific personas to fullfill the request. unless you have a skill card\n- Main actor once again only has a voice in VERY few cutscenes.\n-Last boss on HARD

So you will need to have played that to understand what is going on. \nStory wise, it is not as good as the original, but it definitely has its moments, and I think its a good sequel that doesn't feel forced.\nAs far as the combat, at first it can feel really off putting because of the Dynasty Warriors style, to remedy this, you can bump up the difficulty to hard. the mini bosses and bosses are actually pretty fun this way and the gameplay elements blend together pretty well.\nDefinitely give this a try if you enjoyed the original Persona 5. it is well worth it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "caf4a60dcf655a2d8044051c84a50ab4", "author": "c8bc34c6ffaf5a84bdb2c92788fc7d8e", "date": "2021-03-19", "hours": 4617, "content": "Amazing game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fdbd1701a80e58afb3d76ee17f06f442", "author": "d305228ba9fe5947b254c434db3b52cf", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 2170, "content": "More Then A Spinoff!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e995a21ec3625ea0bdfa90cae5dd4fb9", "author": "210df714a3b552bfa389f5180f040b43", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 3577, "content": "There is no reason why this game should be as good as it is.

La ou Persona 5 \u00e9tait innovateur dans l'optimisation de ses commandes de combat pour \u00e9viter aux joueurs une navigation dans les menu laborieuse, P5S r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 adapter \u00e7a au cadre du Musou, les encha\u00eenements se font tr\u00e8s naturellement pass\u00e9 quelques heures de jeu et le sentiment d'an\u00e9antir des dizaines et des dizaines d'ombres est grisant m\u00eame apr\u00e8s 40h de jeu.\n\nPour les amoureux de la B.O de Persona 5 vous avez avec P5S l'occasion de vous remettre dans cette ambiance avec de nouveau th\u00e8me et certains repris directement de P5.\n\nPetit b\u00e9mol cependant si vous souhaitez r\u00e9aliser tout les troph\u00e9es, l'un d'eux demande un grinding assez lourd qui n'est pas forc\u00e9ment tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. \n\nMis \u00e0 part \u00e7a le pari P5S est une r\u00e9ussite selon moi, il a r\u00e9ussi l'espace d'une cinquantaine d'heures \u00e0 me transporter dans cet univers que j'avais ador\u00e9 il y a 3 ans, avec un r\u00e9el plaisir de revoir Joker et son \u00e9quipe reprendre du service !\n\nEnfin est-ce que ce jeu peut \u00eatre int\u00e9ressant pour quelqu'un qui n'a pas touch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9pisode original mais qui aime tout simplement les musou ? Selon moi oui, bien sur il peut \u00eatre int\u00e9ressant de regarder un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du 5 avant car il y a tr\u00e8s peu d'explication sur l'histoire de P5 originale dans ce jeu. Mais d'un point de vue gameplay pur ce P5S introduit des m\u00e9canique nouvelle dans ce genre de jeu qui selon moi subit beaucoup de reskin mais \u00e9volue rarement !", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bd5cd216b6db54d8a6c5afdfca460167", "author": "f08f85d0139a5f489c860ff0842bb325", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 3756, "content": "Sophie\u89c9\u9192\u90a3\u6bb5\u611f\u52a8\u54ed\u4e86", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74553ee0079c5db68c551d82448cfa73", "author": "51ee914847895de6beead222cc02f692", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 9043, "content": "Some things to know: \nIf you haven't played base game or Royal please do yourself a favor and play them. This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a5dc2e56c5405289ac596d0a5ee50ee6", "author": "dcc30aa2836f5ab2ad28060556b4238b", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 2252, "content": "game good\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "db1bf999192458aa820c5a1376b2782a", "author": "1579272f612850aab7a42e15d886f2a8", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 7827, "content": "best game I've played so far this year", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bac855c8e50a58959b5490dea9d97334", "author": "9706166421d65565a1c252c10c420745", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 3257, "content": "Great game, but crashes often on loading screens.

What I can't quite figure out is why it crashed? One of the times it happened I was just walking from one area of the real world to another, it wasn't even if a particularly crowded area with a lot of NPC's. The first time it happened it happened during a dialogue scene (the one in the attic towards the start of the game), which should be even less likely because it wasn't even loading anything at the time. Of course, I am hyping this up to be more of a problem then it actual is, and there is a chance that it may just be something my computer is doing. \n\nstory wise:\nHonestly, I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. This is a sequel game, if you played the original, you'll like this one, if you haven't you'd probably find a lot of the character beats uninteresting. The sole exception to that is the two new thieves, one of which is just adorable and the other of which is one of the funniest characters in any video games I have ever played.  Also, keep in mind that this game is a lot shorter then the original, which to be fair was a long game, but even beyond time spent, the first couple of dungeons were fillery, not bad, just not particularly important. I still had fun with it though.\n\nGame play:\nNo, it is not turn based, and yes the new combat can take a little bit to get used to, but its fun in its own way and I really enjoyed it and it makes this game feel like its own distinct thing and not just Persona 5 expect smaller and a tacked on story.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7f76b96508a15005bb229f2d2f76728d", "author": "203e28d7aa775ae0ad283b39dd77ab70", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 2310, "content": "No Kasumi Yoshizawa but it's okay cause Ann is still here.

This is instead a look at the game from a series perspective, so there may be other reviews more suited to your taste if this is not what you're looking for. I am not including a TL:DR because the review is a little scatterbrained despite it's length. If this helps even one person then I'm glad.\n\nIn many ways, Persona 5 Strikers is like a sequel to Persona 5. This isn't an original statement, as many describe the game this way, but the fact that it can be described as a sequel speaks volumes for one simple reason: P5S is just a spinoff. Atlus, along with the other studio that helped produced this work, were so bold as to mix ideas from the long-standing Persona/SMT with combat likened to Nier:Automata and Devil May Cry. It's very well done; the aesthetic that makes 5 stand out is still present here, and it is very faithful to the original game. I wouldn't say that it follows up perfectly after the release of Persona 5 Royal, (because this game released in Japan about a month before Royal went worldwide) so don't expect any of the characters/content from Royal here. I will say that a lot of the ideas for Royal were taken from this game, such as the thought process behind the Showtime! mechanic, so if you're familiar with some of the more recognizable content they added in Royal which was not present in the base Persona 5, you'll be glad to find it here. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers does contain some slight spoilers for Persona 5, so be warned if you haven't experienced 5 that there may be some things that are present here which could surprise you. I want to mention one key aspect that this game made me constantly think about though: the only thing holding Persona 5 Strikers, a SPINOFF title, from feeling like a main series game, was the lack of any confidant/social link mechanic. While this is disappointing, the fact that this can even be considered a downside should speak volumes for the game itself. There are only two instances in the game where any activity related to hanging out with a friend from the confidant/social link mechanics in other Persona games exist here. However, it should be considered greatly that following the events from Persona 5, you should not even need a confidant/social link bond with the characters in this game, considering that aside from the two new additions, you've already met and experienced hardship as well as friendship with every other character as the Phantom Thieves. \n\nAnother major advantage this game has is replayability and content. In your first playthrough, if you are even just a little adventurous, you will likely fuse most of the personas and have done just about all of the unique mini bosses present. Although, unlike in base 5 and Royal, the hardest difficulty for this game is locked behind a first completion of the game and then the completion of the post-game content. Let me say that if you're like me, and want a challenge from a game, the hard difficulty from a generic playthrough provides more difficulty than Persona 5/Royal's hardest difficulty. The hardest difficulty in this game is much, much more difficult than that. So trust me when I say that this game has enough content and replayability value, especially for those who want the challenge and unique achievements you can only gain through a merciless NG+ run. \n\nAs a final statement for this review, which has been all over the place, there is one more thing I want to mention. Fans of Persona 5 love the game for a lot of reasons; it's not a huge stretch to say it's a masterpiece in it's very flooded genre, which happens to be one of my favorite game genres. In my (and many others) experience, the music for Persona 5 is the one of the best parts of the whole experience. I am especially happy to say that the new music found in Persona 5 Strikers, be it the new battle themes and remixes of old battle themes or the background/tone setting music, is fan-fu**in-tastic. My personal favorite songs are \"Crossover\" and \"Counter Strike\", so be sure to check them out if you love the music but aren't sure about getting the game. Thanks to anyone who happened to read through this, and sorry for not having a TL:DR. If this helps even one person make the decision either to or not to buy the game, then that is enough for me. Let's hope for more PC releases and ports for this series and SMT!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "92d4b25a36c95bc09013cd0b4d93d051", "author": "0b3b347d68f05eb09248ea8806bad0b1", "date": "2021-03-18", "hours": 669, "content": "The game is great.

I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse. Example:\n\nPersona 5: Confidants, city activities, new game plus upon completion of the title. \nPersona 5 Strikers: No confidants (replaced by team friendship or whatever its called), all of the previous confidants are gone on vacation in the city and you will never see them. New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything.

Not in this game. \n\nI found myself confused at what this game want to be, and while I recommend this game; I can say that it is not what I was expecting, even after playing the demo. \n\nThe good: it is P5, including all the tropes you already know if you played the P5 or other persona games; but the combat is fundamentally what change things around. In P5 you have turn based combat; you need to be stealthy and can be very strategic; to the point where each game session take hours to go through; because the game is fundamentally a RPG.\n\nHere you have a similar approach; but the combat is a 1 vs many as in other musou games. This would not be bad if the game was allowing you to roam around and just decimate the ton of generic enemies like in other dinasty warriors games; but here you can't do that. First because your health and SP are ridiculously low; so playing a musou game like a musou game would end up in quick game over. So you end up playing a game that is like a light version of P5 and with real time combat instead of the turn based. It is weird, and you can see it once you start to play the game.\n\nThe demo does not show you that aspect of the game; so if you play the demo, be ready for P5S to be different from the demo. What bother me the most is the long amount of time needed to play each stage; you need to play this game not like a musou game, and that is what I don't really like.\n\nAlso the game is very confusing with the UI and all effects going on. With P5 it is ok because you are in a turn based flow; no need to move the camera, no need to press buttons together to execute a special attack; so the flair of the artistic choices in the UI are welcome.\n\nHere it is a mess; while you try to make a combo; can't see what is going on, and if an enemy is ready for the \"pile up\" attack you do with the B button; you can't see it unless you rotate the camera constantly to be aware of your surroundings. The combat itself is fast paced and mid tier enemies can mess you up fast, if you don't pay attention. Not sure if it is the angle, the field of view or what else, but this game does not play as well as a dinasty warrior game for sure; so getting a feel for what is going on is really hard.\n\nOther than that, I enjoy the game overall; but if I would know that this game is more like P5 with real time combat and less dinasty warriors, I would probably wait for a sale, instead of buying it at full price.\n\n7 out of 10 for me; lots of hours to sink in; if you can put up with the difficulty and the flashy UI during combat", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "20734aefa7ee54009a352fcbfecaed3b", "author": "d375f93a53f15d028f0d617eb4c5502e", "date": "2021-03-17", "hours": 2928, "content": "so far this game sLAPS, although twice now I've crashed whilst going into the Velvet Room and I have a very good computer soooo... dunno I give it 4.9/5 stahs", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "93b610a7768c551ab3bd5e19d6feff9f", "author": "0491141b926d578da6bf047fb9d2f225", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 3523, "content": "Si este juego tuviera el mismo sistema de combate que el Persona 5 original, seria un juego aun mejor.\n\nExcelente juego en general\n\nPuntaje: 9/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cd0b80aa09445598ab20cd214552c755", "author": "b9500c5b9b3f5677b3b0b88d75a9b473", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 3513, "content": "If you played Persona 5 you should play this it is really good.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b280c4576ff05874989c4b5b4aa86de7", "author": "3fc65ff02a6f5bcfb4736da59c42f418", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 4766, "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or any mainline Persona games, the gameplay will be a departure, but the story is still very good.\n\nDon't sleep on this one.", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e8e26605f5b45e6aa3b55e809b3ee8bd", "author": "4dad398fa3ee5e7abf65e8e90d84d66e", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 28, "content": "yes", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c77c028956ec569d88614cbe0a2bb402", "author": "dd45abaa4a5f5feda045b8a0e3c8661d", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 4637, "content": "I love this game but, don't buy it on steam.

The main star is an awesome action combat system that is extremely faithful to the trademark Persona JRPG combat mechanics. Every single character is very different and a lot of fun to play. It's so good that I'd be happy if every Persona game going forward had it. A bunch of jamming new songs from Lyn, and returning remixed favorites as well. A lot of quality-of-life changes to fusion. The new characters are interesting, likable, and have good character arcs. It's also a much more manageable ~40 hours than the ~100+ of P5.\n\nThe story is a little fanfictiony, which is somewhat expected in Persona spin-off games. You'd better like Japanese food, because the game basically revolves around how awesome it is. The main departure from Persona 5 is the lack of a \"time economy\" (aka limited days) and the lack of social links.\n\nIt's pretty mandatory to have played Persona 5 (either version, references to Royal are basically non-existent); it will spoil large parts of the plot (if you care about that sort of thing), but more importantly, you'd have a hard time caring about the characters without the 100+ hours of context from P5.\n\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f1118f96fd3b5b8f897bb85514ef7a4b", "author": "b779120bdf305b0197555dcc8a5f46e2", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 3425, "content": "I was completely negative when this game was announced instead of a P5 Switch version.

As a spin-off product, it's difficult to recommend as a standalone title without having played Persona 5 before.  And if you much prefer turn based RPGs to action combat, I would pass on this.  But if you clear those hurdles, you'll find a fun game with enjoyable characters and stylish fights.\n\nRather than overly extol praise about all the great things, this format is easier:  Everything about this game is top notch, except\n\n-There are some crash to desktop issues when leaving dungeons.  I recommend saving at every checkpoint, every time, so you won't lose much progress.\n-Given the nature of the battles, sometimes it can be tricky to keep track of all potential threats as you dash about.  Sometimes you can get hit with a nasty attack from off-screen without warning, and that makes you feel like a very un-stylish phantom thief.  Same goes for when you get knocked down during a cool combo.  Desperately waggling a joystick isn't a terribly fun mechanic.\n-Most of the side quests feel a bit boring, and have you repeatedly backtracking old dungeons.  Thankfully, the checkpoints are many, and the objectives are fairly reasonable.\n\nAnd that's my review.  Buy this game, be a Japanese teen, and beat up god(s) with the power of friendship.

By no means is it a cheap spinoff. That said, while I'm sure the game can be enjoyed and understood without playing Persona 5/Royal, I highly recommend either watching a playthrough of Royal, emulating the base Persona 5 (making sure to buy your own copy of the game and ripping it yourself instead of other means, of course!) or if you have a PS4, playing Royal. \n\nStrikers is a 30-40 hour return with the familiar party members of Persona 5, with some new faces, and a new plot. Once again, Atlus outdid themselves in making the party feel like a tight-knit group of friends, and even gave some much needed character development to those left hanging from the original. (looking at you, Haru, Ann, and Yusuke)\n\nPersonally, the shift to a Dynasty Warriors type real-time combat system is... fine. It doesn't do anything special for me, and honestly with most boss/miniboss fights it just devolves into spamming the same couple skills until you can't anymore. That said, the translation from a turn-based JRPG to real-time action was done very well, I just personally would prefer the incredible innovations on the turn-based JRPG formula that the original games provided.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game is sublime. Much like Persona 5 itself, the game just bleeds style, on everything from the animations to the menu UI. The music is also just exceptional, especially since it takes some of the best tracks from Persona 5 and gives them some new, almost metal, life.\n\nI did have some issues with random crashes between loads (running an i9-9900k and a 1070ti for reference), so make sure you save often, but they maybe happened four or five times in my fourty or so hours, and would in no way detract from the shining recommendation that I can give for this game.\n\nMakoto best girl", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1ab0d8673b1057e68e69efb84bf24b59", "author": "0fd19544d9bd5defb7e29da85acad76f", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 1922, "content": "vacation w/ friends", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09c49a6855655a668094da2fc79bd184", "author": "507bbfa06be957098b4e25e77ec071fc", "date": "2021-03-16", "hours": 2775, "content": "As a big fan of the Persona series, I can't recommend the game in it's current state.

Okay, now that that obligation is done, here's an actual review.\n\nDisclaimer: At time of writing, this game has weird issues on PC. You should play in either borderless window or windowed mode in general to reduce load times. I had this installed on an SSD and when it ran in full screen it took a solid 30 seconds to a minute to load while in the bordered modes took about 5 seconds. Not to mention if you do play fullscreen you'll frequently get stuck in loading screens. This occurred when playing in windowed for me a few times as well so it's still a toss-up if you lose progress or not. Unfortunately, this happened most frequently after big boss fights for me and was very frustrating. Running in administrator mode seems to help with these issues as well but this game really needs some patches.\n\nStrikers was a surprise. I happened to be finish Royal the day that Strikers released and was eager to return to the world of Persona 5. As much as I find that Musou are not to my taste, this game really hit the right nerve. It tries to adapt the strengths of Persona to a Musou format and achieves this fairly well. It's still a button masher but each character controls differently from one another and being able to swap between 4 party members on the fly is a nice feature. The game is just as stylistic and flashy as the original P5 with a hard-rock twist to the original's already amazing soundtrack.\n\nThe story itself is fairly lighthearted especially compared to P5 and Royal. Strikers is a road trip video game which is something we don't see often and made me immediately fall in love with this tone. The characters are generally having more fun and surprisingly the English voice acting for Strikers might be better than P5 or Royal. Characters feel more expressive and emotive and I laughed a lot more at this game than the previous entry. The story does go towards a direction I didn't like at the end by retreading themes you've seen before but overall, I did enjoy it even if it is entirely unnecessary.\n\nOverall, a fun time and a worthwhile, albeit unnecessary, follow-up to Persona 5. If you can deal with the issues I mentioned and are looking for a charming and lighter return to the Phantom Thieves, this road trip across Japan is a solid recommendation.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d725120103745896b70c1cc1ed3f9bf0", "author": "a7cc0e6bcb9c595d97ba8cdfd1aa5516", "date": "2021-03-15", "hours": 2708, "content": "A worthy sequel to an already excellent game.

Some in game interfaces are garbage (like Sophie shop where you have to do 4 clicks to buy 1 item (multiply on number of items you want to buy))\n6.

The gameplay is fluid, the story and characters are all fully fleshed out with good interactions and arcs through the plot. \n\nThe one gripe one can make is the crashing issues, however for me it was hardly as bad as anyone else. I only crashed when I used external software to improve the anti-aliasing.

This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point. I promise.\n\nI'm not quite at the end as of this review, but I estimate the full game takes about 50-60 hours to complete depending on how side-quest happy you tend to be.", "comments": 2, "source":

Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!\n\nEdit: ATLUS IS GIVING US MORE PERSONA ON STEAM!

As someone who's only watched the anime, and was too desperate to wait for a possible port, I played this game right away and spent a good bit getting to know everyone. The game does refer back to Persona 5 so play at your discretion.\n\nPersona 5 strikers is a dynasty warrior-like game with different unique elements from the persona series. This leads to a simple to learn gameplay loop which becomes very rewarding once you learn it. It's always fun to dish out character's specific combos along with their persona abilities when fighting hordes of enemies making you feel powerful. On top of this, you can perform an all-out attack to heighten how badass you are. The music complements both regular fights and boss fights hyping you up for each encounter making anything you do stylish and exciting. Some remixes I prefer over the original!\n\nThe downfall is you can easily get burnt out with long play sessions and listening to \"What You Wish For\" for the 500th time..... For gameplay, I'd recommend breaks or playing the game a bit every day.\n\nThe story is as interesting as always which improves the further you get into it. On the side, you'll interact with members of the phantom thieves which always left a smile on my face with the chemistry they share always being a delight to watch unfold. Even the new characters work well making everything fresh. \n\nThe only issue I had was the 2nd and 3rd Dungeons/ story were some of the weakest but that's down to my taste. In terms of gameplay nothing, you do matters. From dialog options to choices (Bar one exception but nothing comes from it), there's no real reason to worry about what you do because the game still progresses, you can't romance anyone and there's one end. It is nice though to hear how people respond to what you say.\n\nIf you're aiming to 100% the game. It's a good bit of work but if you have spare time on your hands or are a simp for persona, definitely go for it. Just be warned when maxing the bond levels and doing all side tasks.\n\nI'd recommend this game if you love the persona games it's deferentially a good bit of fun. However, I'd say wait for the price to drop a bit because while a great game it's not for everyone. 7.5/10 Very good ^^\n\nSide Note:\nSophie is the most precious soul in the game and is probably my favorite female character... Sorry, Makoto. I swear she was always able to brighten my mood and has so many great character moments and development.

For me, it was the first of the series that I bought and played on the recommendation of a close friend. I grew to love Persona 5 so much that I had ended up playing the game over and over, committing all I could to memory. I wanted to observe every nuance of what made Persona 5 the game it was, or rather is. I even bought the Persona 5 Royal version and fell in love all over again. When I first saw Persona 5 Strikers I immediately looked into it, like any fan would. The trailer video was encaptivating, but I hesitated to buy. The completely overhauled battle system worried me. The original Persona 5 battle system encompassed a long time familiar style of RPG turn-based battles most gamers of the genre are familiar with. Additionally, the time management aspect coupled with building confidants added an endearing allure. Strikers, a now hack & slash version, redesigned combat from the ground up. Personally, I avoid games like this because I recognize my lack of ability and commitment to build the skills necessary to dominate the battlefield. The realization that I may not enjoy this game disheartened me for the longest time. Many times I skipped passed Strikers in the Steam store. However, maybe due to overwhelming boredom, I began perusing the comments of players who had played the game. I can't remember the poster, but they shared the same concern as my own. After reading it, I decided that even if I didn't love the game, that I loved the Persona franchise so much that I'd support it regardless. On that note...\n\nUSE THE GAMEPAD CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME! Standard keyboard setup is not sufficient for this game.\n\nInitially, I disliked combat, and I disliked the feeling of having my Persona 5 world condensed into the shell of an \"efficient game\". What I mean is the play style and aspects of play seemed to have been developed in a way that screams \"instant satisfaction\". Not that it's a bad thing. It just seemed hollow in comparison to its predecessor. I was starting to feel a disconnect to the series. \"I guess they're just trying to monetize on the success of the story.\" The thought spoke loudly in my head. As I started to progress into the game, it was clear that my preconceived notions were wrong.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, albeit different from Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, is still an amazing game. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts still managed to steal this skeptical heart of mine. Though I find the battle system complex and difficult to use well, it still offers a new and fun perspective. If you've played Persona 5 or Royal, this game is guaranteed to throw you for a loop. But don't give up. If you're a true Phantom Thief, you'll rise to the challenge and steal the love for this game you once had. Give it a chance.

Which might sound not as hard, but trust me its very much as hard if not harder than persona 5's gameplay.

What I mean by that is, it does continue after the events of the original Persona 5 but the Royal version which is arguably much better is not canon in Strikers which puts it in a weird place. Unfortunately, you still need to play Persona 5 or Royal, to understand and appreciate the story and its characters. I say unfortunately but that isn't really a bad thing because you should 100% play the original games because they're amazing. \n\nNow onto Persona 5 Strikers story, you play as Joker again who returns for the summer vacation back to Shibuya. As he gets back together with the gang he again ends up in the prison where everything started in the original P5. He is warned that another calamity is about to happen just like before, even worse, and it's up to the Trickster to stop it again. \n\nThis time around you encounter Jails instead of Castles which are at their core the same but with a different skin/background. I won't spoil their nature but suffice to say they follow the same pattern, you roam around the maps which are more open now due to the nature of the gameplay, fight enemies, then the final boss, calling card all that, and repeat several times. Even the way the ending is presented is similar, you'll understand once you reach it. \n\nYou will meet new characters and some of them will even join your group to help you fight the upcoming calamity. As for the original cast, they're all back and they're all the same as you know and love them. Their presence is what makes the Persona 5 series great. Be warned though the game has a lot of dialogue in its full 45 hours and you'll be spending even an hour or more just listening and reading. \n\nStory rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs I've mentioned before P5S is a spin-off because this time around it's not a turn-based rpg anymore but an hack&slash with few rpg mechanics borrowed from the original game. \n\nThe core is there but simplified and turned into action. You roam around the maps, attack the enemies, and engage in combat but instead of turn-based, they now spread around the map and you basically Devil May Cry their ass using the Personas you gather or create which is the specific skill of the Trickster. The abilities and the Personas are the same but \"ported\" to live-action combat. What that means is besides slashing your way through huge waves of enemies, you can also use skills that you are familiar with in an aoe pattern. \n\nObviously, you will not be fighting alone and 3 of your preferred teammates will be there to assist you. They have their own AI and will use skills and attacks but you can switch to them and play as them if you want to which is highly encouraged especially on Hard. You cannot swap your teammates in combat, only outside, so make sure before a boss or tough sub-boss to be prepared who you have by your side. Their skills are also exactly the same as the original so you won't have to worry much about that if you played it. The spell combinations, technical damage, Persona, and enemy weakness are all back so really not much is changed at its core besides how combat is displayed. Boss fights are challenging on Hard but fair and they're really fantastic how they crafted and adapted the mechanics to the hack &slash style. \n\nAs P5S is no longer an rpg, all the bonds and talking and everything else you were used to in the original is gone or simplified. The bond system is a simple talent tree in which you spend points you gather progressively through the story and some side quests. Crafting Personas is also very simplified. If this were an actual rpg with mechanics improved from the original, it would've been an amazing experience but hey at least you can still cook stuff so that's a plus. \n\nGameplay rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nObviously, you can play the game with the English cast or the Japanese cast. I prefer Japanese games, set in Japan, to be played with their original voices, not dubs and I will always recommend it that way. Their voices fit well with their characters and if you played the original you'll feel right back at \"home\". The new cast also does a pretty great job at getting you emotionally invested. \n\nThe music is mostly from the original, which is of course, great, but there are some fantastic new tunes, especially the boss ones. As for the sound effects and everything else, all is good, no issues whatsoever. \n\nAudio rating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nFor a console port, I can safely say it's a pretty good job. Not great, not perfect but still good considering this is the second Persona game on PC. It's still only locked to 60 FPS and there aren't that many graphical settings and as usual, the draw distances are weak but not much of an issue.  The game looks crisp in higher resolutions and details and combat effects and spells and whatnot are all nice to look at. \n\nThere are some crashes and it can be very annoying since there will be times where saving is very scarce and you just have to redo parts of the game or a long boss fight. Other than that, I have not encountered any other issues.\n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, then I don't think I can recommend Strikers but if you have there's absolutely no reason not to play it even if the gameplay is different. The characters you love are back and the story while similar in its beats, is still something nice to experience. \n\n[h1]Final score: 8/10[/h1]", "comments": 6, "source": "steam", "helpful": 37, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cdfda91afc27548d86e1570acac46f04", "author": "30111afda0115ba788f254f99e89b078", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 13584, "content": "P5S\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b891b72121b258a08f83fc8c8ad72acb", "author": "7f4a0165a7965916ac10e954df8ace51", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 3080, "content": "We need Persona 5 Royal !!!!\n\n\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u90fd\u582a\u79f0\u4e00\u6d41\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u597d\u5bb3\u6015\u4ee5\u540e\u73a9\u4e0d\u5230\u50cfP5 P4\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\uff0c\u771f3\u91cd\u5236\u5df2\u7ecf\u9884\u8d2d\u4e86\uff0c\u6c42\u6c42A\u793e\u5feb\u70b9\u628aP5R\u4e5f\u642c\u5230steam\u4e0a\u5427", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 80, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bb1ce17b84c253ca87d5deb3d11e2e84", "author": "5cada7e5eeed56b080fdd47e978de2c9", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 2627, "content": "Amazing game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9d69f66d353b533b86b1ac46831f5103", "author": "347e62d6810d5ae595be2e87214a35e3", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 8462, "content": "I'm So Happy playing this game again.\nstoryline and battle so fantastic.\ni'm waiting Persona 6 (if Atlus really make this game)", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "912db61cd4655f9182e56a99c807de67", "author": "2704009a63f554eab72d8d3754f2b229", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 3702, "content": "This game will defenitely not be Atlus' last surprise ;)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d380651b7d3157eeb1b16616abc94bab", "author": "86b8a92cad8a50b89d647e95f7b5725a", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 2567, "content": "Really fuckin fun\n\nNow bring Persona 5 Royal to PC too :^)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7f62c0b5131555099193f022921057ce", "author": "11195eb5d2c15db8a7feb38fdf017a8a", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 1927, "content": "sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh sophia boutta make me act up", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "723cc72c5bac56efada8f1561f5c4484", "author": "4d9c78be62815022b74dcf08e1c71d24", "date": "2021-03-14", "hours": 3540, "content": "My only wish is that if only this game could have had a longer calendar.

The tl;dr is that the gameplay is fun, there's a lot of content and there's a ton of depth in the game's fusion/Persona mechanics.

I'm running a 1650 and Ryzen 5 4600; not stellar components but respectable nonetheless. This game barely runs at 60 on mid/high settings at 900p. Its hilarrious just how poorly the game runs but even that isn't a dealbreaker. I wish the game ran better but I can handle a poorly optimized game as long as its stable but hoo boy is this game not stable. I'm around halfway through Strikers and I have had five separate crashes in my 20 hour playtime. Think about it, that's a crash every 4 hours. And the game doesn't have an autosave feature so you're bound to lose progress eventually. This is the ultimate reason why I cannot recommend P5S. If the game gets patches to solve the issues I've mentioned above, then yes, definitely buy this game.

SCORE: 7/10 Only recommend to fans, wait for Persona 5 for newbies.\n\nEvery review so far focuses on meme-like quotes or one thing that happens in the game. So, I'll tell you whats really in the game. The gameplay is more like Kingdom Hearts but with bigger mobs (not big mobs like Hyrule Warriors). It still retains Persona abilities and fusion but the fusion has been simplified from other entries. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and you have a fair bit of strategy to put into every fight especially the boss fights. The bosses alone will give you the sweatiest palms as they are harder than any of the Persona games by far. What I dislike about the game is its story. The Phantom Thieves are compelled to feel empathy for the antagonist of each city you go to. The writing feels very shallow even more so that in Persona 5. Also its been 20+ hrs for me and the game is still constantly holding my hand while traversing thru the maps. Like come on, don't insult my intelligence. And yes unfortunately the game is prone to crashing and it happens more often while transitioning to a new area. It becomes incredibly frustrating after you defeat an annoying boss and then the game crashes making you restart that fight. It's definitely worth $60 for returning Phantom Thieves but if this is your first Persona game I would wait until Atlus fixes the crashes and the game goes on sale for $40 or below.

The other major thing that some will harp on is the lack of the \"social sim\" aspect, it's more as a group collective this time around instead of juggling your time between school, 1 on 1s and the metaverse, you tackle things as a team from start to finish. I don't believe that to be a drawback and fits in with the more fast paced nature of Strikers.\n\nThroughly fun game and would recommend to any Persona fan. Being a sequel to P5, the game will assume you know all prior events and the team members so if you never played P5 it is not \"friendly\" in that respect to totally new players.

The animations for All Out Attacks aren't quite as flashy, the game doesn't have as much meat to it, there are a lot of quality of life features missing, and much fewer voice clips for common actions like buying, selling, or aiming a gun (meaning that you're going to hear the exact same line spoken over and over and over again). However, saying that Strikers isn't as good as P5 or Royal is like saying an uncut diamond isn't as good as a 24-karat gold ring; in either case, what you have is still pretty damn good. \n\nIf you've never played P5 before, don't be mistaken into thinking you can just leap into this game. It picks up after the events of the previous game and does very little to backtrack over who characters are or what events happened, which is great for returning fans since they can just right back into the action, but newcomers will be left totally lost. There is probably still an enjoyable story here for newbies, but he finer points will be lost--and considering just how important story is to the Persona series--it is a large thing to miss out on. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever return to this game now that I've beaten it. I honestly prefer the turn-based RPG battles of normal P5, and Royal is just filled with so much better content and quality-of-life features that I've grown so accustomed to that, should I ever feel the urge to jump back into Persona, I think I'll be popping in Royal long before Strikers. \n\nAll that said, however, this was still a damn fun game and I'm glad I played it. I feel like it's even worth full asking price if you're really a fan. If not, than there's no shame waiting for a sale, too.

The game not being turn-based did scare me a bit and yes, it is very difficult in the first 5 or so hours but after a while I got used to it and when you learn to mix combos and weaknesses it gets really fun to play (the teammates are also super fun to use; Yusuke, Haru and Wolf especially), Jails (basically dimestore Palaces) are very creative and beautiful to look at, the boss fights are incredible and I honestly liked the boss fights in Strikers more than than original P5. The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it.

Se sapete bene l'inglese vi consiglio vivamente di mettere il gioco in inglese, e per quanto riguarda il doppiaggio secondo me \u00e8 meglio mille volte quello giapponese, per\u00f2 fate come meglio preferite e godetevi questo bel titolo!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a0499af1303258c3b8085c48c5d56ff9", "author": "02853080a58157f1b3af6dacea64f360", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 2246, "content": "aye", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2e9edf2668bf53d49c32df3608caad35", "author": "874a06c9d59c53d5926783721b5fa7d3", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 4308, "content": "An amazing fun sequel to a great game, hope to see Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal on steam", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a333b42640e855c9b57414948b949cc8", "author": "f7ed2e8f42eb5edebc327f047e2d2684", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3625, "content": "I want to play the game because I love it but I also can't play the game because then it will be over and I'll probably cry :) \n\n\nI was right :(", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "882135bdadb553dba2a598d469eb39a4", "author": "72339e1c3a1c57baa852265422834aaa", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 6189, "content": "you damn kids", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "81f355f27abd5f54a05a2e06f9b0a992", "author": "513c120a8c2a55068bdbf1feac42cac0", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3273, "content": "Glorious sequel.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "41f9447f238a5b6984d9a6d3dfb9e85a", "author": "e755a542ea8f5a7581a22109d561baad", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 2830, "content": "Sehr gutes Spin-Off zu Persona 5 mit leicht anderer Mechanik.

It is a great spin-off that actually adds something to the characters' stories from the last game.  I will say that if you have not played the previous Persona 5, then I do not recommend this to be your first game in the series.  The game really does assume that you know what happened previously and only does a bit of background knowledge.\n\nAnother caveat, this game is NOT turn-based like the other Persona games.  Now, while I prefer turn-based combat, this games combat is extremely fun.  It is not just random button mashing, but instead a bit more strategy needs to be put into each fight no matter the difficulty.  I played the whole game on hard and I will say that at the start it will kick your ass if you have no experience playing musou games.  However, once you start to understand the combat, the personas, each character, and the skills then the game becomes a lot more easier (still not easy, but you will have better knowledge into the combat).\n\nStory-wise, this game is extremely strong much like Persona 5/Royal.  Is it as good a story?  No, but then again the length of the game is like one half that of the normal games.  I will not write any spoilers, but I did enjoy the story with each character still being the same, but growing a bit.  It is such a good feeling to see the Phantom Thieves interacting with one another, in both the happy scenes and the more serious ones too.  The addition of some new characters was something that I was worried about, but I think they handled it remarkably well.  They both have interesting backgrounds, interactions, and actually important to the story.  \n\nJust one last mention, the music is fantastic again.  It sounds just like Persona 5 which I loved back when I played it and I still love it now.\n\nIssues I had with the game.  I see that people have struggled with crashes and I will say that I only crashed once and thankfully I had saved like a minute prior.  But, I do think that each person's game will act differently so make sure to save as much as possible!  The other issue I had with this game is just the lack of side stuff to do with the Phantom Thieves like what was possible in the previous versions.  I did not expect nearly as much as the last games, but I think there could have been more interesting \"requests\" with the members.\n\nI highly recommend this game!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "30c2c0fa03de5556ab68f70b4f0fcd39", "author": "3f89d6907a6d523497e21d46aaa2ca75", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 2191, "content": "peepeepoopoo game crashed like 20 times on me including right before the ending cutscene.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "45735203410d5a08ba46fea3462e532d", "author": "8885978406f25232894233e1a053c99c", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 7331, "content": "Its That Good Shit.\n\nEdit: Still is", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8857662a66a25683a9c9ae26fb4d1e1b", "author": "2d475fafed525647932246340c758729", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3908, "content": "10/10 would hear [spoiler]Ryuji say fuck again[/spoiler]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "85820e220b7b570fa9e64d275755d691", "author": "b5428f3da5f355af948506157e179845", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 4677, "content": "Un excellent jeu, d'une excellente licence, enfin sur une excellente plateforme !\nUne histoire vraiment int\u00e9ressante et tr\u00e8s entra\u00eenante, et un syst\u00e8me de combat original pour une telle s\u00e9rie, mais pourtant toute aussi fun !\n\n[strike]Pourquoi un avis n\u00e9gatif alors ?\nTrop de crash, toujours, toujours, toujours lors de chargements, vous faisant perdre un temps monstrueux\nCorrigez \u00e7a, et je reverrai mon avis[/strike]\n\nComme Atlus semble avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9 les joueurs, les probl\u00e8mes semblent r\u00e9solus, en tout cas, je n'ai plus eu de crash depuis la sortir du hotfix !\n\nDu coup, je recommande \u00e9videmment ce jeu !", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "269a887861f85bef87ff1bb11fc76ec5", "author": "2f54283a10b6580a9acbd6c95044dece", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 9021, "content": "Such great, many funs. 10/10 would take to dinner... wow.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09407b4c8817591fb3f4065590a2a16c", "author": "132bb9f7d2a65153b6c618f2db2edbfb", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3529, "content": "\u51f9\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u51f9\u7684\uff0c\u627e\u98ce\u54e5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f29c9ae6b398580d8502c2c09c295e93", "author": "682b9d2af0dc5e2ab5441325902479c1", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 20812, "content": "This game is good, but this PC port is absolutely trash.

"3b3717e6fe325e7aa65af6b102c78229", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3922, "content": "I genuinely don't like the [b] original [/b] Persona 5. The characters and story all felt extremely bland to me, with its supposed themes being executed with the bare minimum of effort placed into it. Most characters were bland and some were even annoying. Including the wasted potential of the ideas the game presented, in the end it just left me unsatisfied. The only saving grace of the original game to me was the gameplay, the style, and a few tracks of the ost.\n\nThis game however [b] is not [/b] the original Persona 5 and it really shows, not just with its gameplay, but with its genuine thought and care placed into its characters and plot with only one minor hiccup being the obvious twist. Besides that this game blows the original P5 out of the park with everything it has to offer.\nThe game's new characters Zenkichi and Sophia are some of the best persona characters I've ever gotten to experience, Sophia specifically now being my all time favorite with her fun personality and amazing growth as a person, or in her case an AI. Learning about emotions as the story progresses and learning what it means to have a heart. Zenkichi isn't too far behind her though, being the first adult of the Phantom Thieves does bring in some fun banter between him and them all, usually with him being called \"Gramps\" and teased for being a bit of a dork. Him being part of the police as well adds some more chemistry with the Thieves bringing in a pretty fun dynamic between them reminding them they can't go and break the law for their shenanigans. Both of them make for amazing additions to an already set in stone team.\nThe themes presented with its villains really struck a cord with me this time around actually making me feel some emotion on my part. A majority of them even relate with some of the main characters own lives which makes for really interesting lines of dialogue where they reflect on it and how it must've affected the villains' thoughts.\nThe gameplay is absolutely outstanding with it's fast based combat, being similar to a warriors game of course it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I really did enjoy it. Every characters moveset felt unique, fun, and extremely flashy. All of which just makes the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThere are negatives of course, this game may be close to a perfect 10 but there are a few glaring issues with the game.\nCrashes and soft locks aren't a common occurrence but they really shouldn't be happening in the first place considering how it never happens on consoles, I may have been able to get used to it but some people won't.\nThe way fusions work in this game feel incredibly tedious requiring incredibly low level personas to be at levels like 40 and 50 to create the fusion, which later on is a lot easier but in the beginning is absolutely annoying.\n\nBesides those issues however I really think this is the best Persona game in the series. Definitely not a jump on point for newcomers, but I really recommend it if you're already into persona and wanting a fun action game. It certainly made this P4 die hard quite happy.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0dbe2ce82dba5945bd0327d7c0821173", "author": "2193c0933ed1582d8506a3742d9740cd", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 2358, "content": "\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7684\u4e00\u6bb5\u5192\u9669\uff0c\u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\uff0c\u602a\u76d7\u56e2\uff0c\u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\uff0cJoker", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "09f64771202755878f5d6330c06280a1", "author": "cc1ca02bd40c5ed9beb56d351ffb2071", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3381, "content": "T", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "558f00c977fb5daf9651d15c9c54a990", "author": "9feece700991531abc05144e7762a628", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 4948, "content": "i like playing as zenkichi cus hes a dad and he also feels like the dad of the phantom thieves so whenever they fuck up by like wastin' sp by usin' a healing skill when i don't need it i can be mad at them but like in a dad way. pretty good game, except for the part when ur on the ferris wheel with futaba and you have the option to say either it's a family trip or it's a romantic date. those two options shouldn't coexist. stop it atlus", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b6141a4e483751968b7805c52d71b499", "author": "ea9bf6b3d3bb597cb22dae1450a0531c", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 812, "content": "When Sophia introduced herself as \"humanities companion,\" I could only think \"companion cube?\"", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4f5e275dedf154589541f37d62c6359e", "author": "f2c43379ee525cbda487132e62a62c50", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 2323, "content": "Gioco Bellissimo E Ottimizzato Veramente Bene", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c462fad9efd35842845dca105c6bc1b9", "author": "6ddacf4359a058da9928ac0f5b0f8ab8", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3035, "content": "\u597d\u8bc4\u8fd8\u662f\u7ed9\u4e86 \u4f46\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u6211\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u4e0d\u597d\u606d\u7ef4\uff0c\u73a9\u5230\u5927\u962a \u573a\u666f\u6389\u5e27\u5f88\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6218\u6597\u4e2d\u654c\u4eba\u8fc7\u591a\u4f7f\u7528showtime\u4f1a\u6162\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1f\u5e76\u4e14\u4f34\u968f\u5267\u60c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u95ea\u9000\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u540e\u7eed\u5c3d\u5feb\u4fee\u590d", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8a25000adf3559bb9a2d82c62828b5bd", "author": "afbf13d69a04524997bbabdf34b10d6d", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 7557, "content": "The kind of game that depresso slaps me in the face when the story has to come to an end.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3f78ea1f134f515e8f660711de0cf04c", "author": "819b1391d5a25c2486e1cb9c1452634c", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 2331, "content": "If Devil May Cry, God of War, and Persona had a majestic baby", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a13e27ca988e5df895db4dd7fa1c6097", "author": "7a769171ef655bc9945e97a9787510c1", "date": "2021-03-12", "hours": 3194, "content": "Je viens de finir le jeu.

I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff?

How could they top the original story? Well they did somehow. The wash of nostalgia and references to the previous game was a real roller coaster of emotions. They did it in such a way without spoiling too much for new players while also satisfying a veteran Persona 5 fan. The writing goes deeper to tackle more grey areas of everyday life with clashing philosophies and facts of life which tickle the brain to the open minded person. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself I was a little concerned that it was going to be a mindless hack and slasher without much depth. I've grown fond of the turn based strategy aspect of regular Persona games, but over time I found that the strategy was still there with faster paced decision making. I loved playing all the characters using familiar mechanics in a much more action packed battlefield. It felt really badass linking moves together with your team and landing those cinematic \"Showtime\" Finishers and All-Out Attacks. The music is a banger too. \n\nThe whole experience was wonderful.

There will be unmarked spoilers.\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Consider this more of a \"meh\" review. If you just wanna see the gang get back together for a demon-slaying road-trip, are willing to be even more fragile than the Demi-Fiend at the start of Nocturne, and don't mind bosses with insane HP values, it's stylish like Persona 5 always has been and may be worth picking up. YMMV with the story. Also, Futaba makes cute noises when you enter the system menu. This is very important.\n\n[b] Gameplay:[/b] Having tried Normal and Hard difficulty settings, it feels all over the place so far. Both incoming and outgoing damage fluctuates on a per-fight basis between being crushed by a black hole (dying/killing in 2-3 hits) or being slapped by a wet noodle, even when exploiting weaknesses. Taking advantage of persona resistances seems to work, but nothing will save your braindead AI companions from standing in pools of whatever element they're weak to and dying/wasting SP on healing. \n\nIt sucks because the most effective way to take down a boss, assuming you don't want to waste twenty minutes whittling it down while it endlessly spawns additional demons, is to stand still, open the command menu so time freezes, switch to a Persona that can exploit its weaknesses, and spam attacks, maybe switching to another character when you run out of SP. \n\nThis is almost necessary because bosses have an obscene amount of HP, and spamming attacks from the menu deals damage far faster than trying to use the free, reduced-strength spells from combos. It also has the side effect of practically guaranteeing you're not getting hit by anything while trying to pull off said combos, which feels really cheap.\n\n\n[b] Story: [/b] I haven't finished the game yet, but so far the stakes are at an all-time low for the Phantom Thieves. The first target was acceptable since she went out of her way to abuse some innocent people, but the second target in particular had me rolling my eyes; as far as I can tell, his only \"crime\" was not admitting that his novels were hot garbage that only sold well because his editors manipulated him and hyped up his status as the grandson of a famous writer. There was a claim about him plagiarizing, but he wouldn't be the first popular author to do just that and get away with it.\n\nForcing that kid to go on live television and \"confess\" to the heinous crime of being manipulated into writing bad novels had me in stitches. At best, it felt like petty revenge for something that happens all the time IRL in all kinds of media. At worst, it could have no lasting effect; realistically all the company would need to do is throw a few employees under the bus along with the kid in some kind of apology letter, wait a few months, and then the public would forget all about it.\n\nIn short, it's a far cry from changing the hearts of the people from Persona 5. Stopping a teacher from preying on students and driving them to suicide? I'm down, no question. \n\nStopping a famous idol from abusing the people around her? Sure, I guess. \n\nStopping a writer from writing bad novels?\n \n...\n\nWho gives a shit?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS",

has been in my opinion, one of the best spin offs of the persona series yet. Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series. It's well worth the money and a good way to kill 35+ hours.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "29d27fdabc855c46aba31ecded68cf7f", "author": "55a42113bf155555bcf7e0415ec62f5d", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 9274, "content": "Even though the game is only about 40 hours long It's a great game and a sequel to Persona 5, The cutscenes are amazing and voice acting and lines are better than the original game in my opinion, The new characters are fun to play with and also have great voice acting. The game doesn't leave you bored due to Its time mechanics and the requests you get, another great feature is the ability to revisit jails and replay boss fights. I'm a big fan of the post-game world since you don't have to repeat the entire game again to reach the grinding point, but of course if you wanna replay the game you can complete the new requests and start a New Game+ . Overall I really recommend this game if you're a fan of Persona 5 or the Persona series", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS",

every mechanic present in Persona 5 is here, from All-out-Attacks, Baton Passes to Showtime Attacks, with some new additions. Seriously, combat is *really* good. Personas fusions and customizations are also very good, even if there are fewer Personas than in the mainline games.\n\nUnfortunately, the other main part of Persona gameplay loop, the time management, is non-existent here. While a shame, it's understandable based on the premise of the game; P5S shows a much more compact story than mainline Persona games, and there's little place for in-depth systems from the original, such as Confidants and such.\n\nAs for the quality of the PC port... crashes and weird antialiasing aside, trying to set up a working keyboard and mouse controls almost gave me an aneurysm. KB+M default controls seem to be made by a person who never touched a PC. All in all, it didn't diminish my experience by much, just made the first two hours of so more frustrating then they need to be.\n\nAll in all, I was afraid this game would be a cheap cashgrab, feeding on the love people have for Persona 5. But it's not, there's a lot of actual quality here; you just need to remember it's a action spin-off, not full Persona experience.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7d2f111d0b7956ae8631fe14fbbad76b", "author": "8258db9ce1dd5aad9fd75967ccda5db7", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 269, "content": "decent game but a trash port, crashes alot.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9005e8d25f2c5f9b8b82f62249a20f31", "author": "308c4092294156b9b7892e26d7a4e6fa", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 4105, "content": "Some would probably hate on this game cuz it's just a persona 5 side concept and not how it's supposed to be or whatever, Really, even tho it's not as in depth as a real persona game, the combat is so much more immersive. you feel 10x more badass when you're the one doing the attacking the shadows rather than being the one telling them to do it in turn based combat. they still managed to keep most implements of persona 5 in this game as well, such as persona fusion and persona acquiring. the only thing missing is confidants which was somewhat replaced by the bond system which is a little more useful for the gameplay switch.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "adee5a3c76b45548b57a1fa8a017d914", "author": "7116930d10815d3b9e10eb17c1f2dc97", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 739, "content": "Great game!

It's damn good.\n\nThis is not a dynasty warriors - style offshoot, a la the fire emblem or zelda warriors games; this is a true, blue sequel.\n\nStory wise, it kinda rehashes the themes of the third semester in P5R, but that's not a bad thing. Some things are better touched on, and some things are less approached. It's a different look at the ideas. In addition, there's a lot of something both P5 and P5R were lacking: team building. The crew hangs out a lot. I mean, A LOT. there's good elaboration of character dynamics, a lot of humor, and it leaves you feeling warm inside the way well written characters do.\n\nThe new characters are well written and enjoyable (much more so than Kasumi, in my opinion). They find their place fairly quickly and latch on to you the way the others did in their own time.\n\nGameplay wise, it's dynasty warriors with some twists. A lot of components of traditional persona combat are integrated, but moved to a reaction based real time style- think of it as the changes from Dragon Age: Origins to DA2, but better. (in my opinion, much better). Strengths, weaknesses, technicals, baton passes and showtimes- they're here.\n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected of the persona franchise, fulla bangers.

It reflects off of Persona 5 and they still keep the Persona 3 vibe, style, and music like its other games. \n\nIf you are a big fan of Shin Megami Tensei, and the older Persona series, you will like this.\n\nAlthough the game's style is much different, and inspired by the types of fighting style games like\nHyrule Warriors Age of Calamity, and Dynasty Warriors.\n\nIts a mobby hack and slash game, so if you want a ton of action this is a much get. Its not a turn based\nRPG like the other titles but you still kick some ass.\n\nWhats great is that instead of just trying to remember a ton of moves, they have them shown\ndown at the bottom of the window of your game to show you what to press if you dont remember how to do\nsome moves. You can also look at the tutorials again in the Options Menu in case you missed something.\nInstead of mashing at the keys, its good to get to know your moves. If you dont you may lose much faster especially\nif you run into a mid boss or something nasty.\n\nIts got a ton of Story, good Music, it has its suspense moments, and comedy too. It has that Anime/Manga feel of it as well.\n\nIm not a reviewer snob (like yelpers) but just leaving an honest review, and its gameplay.\n\nI think the only thing i would complain about is that they dont leave an option to watch the cutscenes\nyou just completed. So if you want to see them again, you dont get to.\n\nI have the bonus content they dont provide any of the animations, only the behind the scenes of the production.\n\nOther than that its still a solid, and clean game. I havent ran into any bugs yet. \n\nThe game is flashy, its colorful, its not plain, and the Ui looks pretty good.\n\nWorth every penny. Buy it!! BUY IT NOW!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL HERE OwO!\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f43f07840d355fa5a2322c693354bab5", "author": "89e7413d94125bbab4bc823d98b89638", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 4220, "content": "I definitely enjoyed this game, but I do have a few bones to pick. Overall? I love it, and definitely recommend it. But I also can't imagine enjoying it anywhere near as much if I hadn't played the prequel.\n\nLoved:\n\n- The travelling by camper van premise. And you can still decorate inside - Nice touch.\n\n- Yusuke. No lie, he's my favourite character. So weird, and usually the one to make me crack a smile or laugh.\n\n- Graphic style. Easy on the eyes!\n\n- Characters, in general. You definitely get a good dose of each of their personalities in the game, which is great.\n\n- Game mechanics. I'm fine with turn-based games, as Persona has been until now, but real time is definitely so much more fun. You can use also use objects in the environment to pull off different moves. Not novel or anything, but definitely makes the battles more dynamic. \n\n- The voice acting. I usually listen to the original voices over the English voices because the latter often bothers me. But here? The voice actors nailed it. Lots of emotion, tone, and personality. That said, I suggest changing the audio configuration ASAP in game, as I find of the base levels of background volume to voice volume to be imbalanced, and sometimes I could not hear the voices over the background music.\n\n- Music was great, as always (okinawa jail bgm is one of my favourites in the game). The upbeat and catchy songs were also very fitting. Having some of the music and songs from P5 was a nice touch/connection, as well.\n\nBones to pick:\n\n- Game length. I did everything possible in about 43 hours in my first run, and I took my time. It's action and content packed with not too many extras, but I had expected there to be a good 20 more hours (including extras) considering its predecessors. I ended up cursing the whole \"only 1 month of summer vacation\" standard of Japan as the reason why the game had to be \"short\".\n\n- Linear/simple story. Doesn't usually bother me, but having played other persona games, it's simple by comparison.\n\n- Personas. So many were cut out in this game - and Persona 5 already had a bunch cut from Persona 4...I had been looking forward to discovering them, seeing how they'd be animated and going to town with them, but there are definitely far fewer.\n\n- Less sneaking around. Ambushing enemies from behind sofas, tables, corners etc in P5 had been fun. In this game it's mostly ambushing from above in some form - nice add-on, but I don't think it should have replaced the other ambush methods. I had also anticipated ambushing from actual shadows/blind spots, which happens in P5, but there wasn't really any of that in this game. It also bothered me that you could perch on some things but not others - e.g. traffic poles (Shibuya arc), but not the concrete lanterns/posts, or even low rooftops (Kyoto arc)? Couldn't see the logic behind that. Also a little disappointed that you couldn't ambush from trees. I guess because of the \"phantom dash\" distance you could leap to various perches, it seems the potential for the context was too limiting.\n\n- I do miss the one on one, sometimes one on two, bonding scenarios from P5. You get a handful of bonding chances in Strikers, but not many. Instead it focuses on group bonding, which shows how tight the Phantom Thieves group is. \n\nPetty disappointments:\n\n- Protagonist has virtually no role this game. Kinda just there to watch his friends be the ones to help/inspire others this time. Would have been nice if each character had their own arc, in addition to the group dynamic, like P5 did.\n\n- Protagonist wears his glasses all game. I was hoping I could take them off...As far as what's been suggested he doesn't even need them, anyway!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a56ca94ffc805965b05e3f2e6479ecd4", "author": "deecfde5b4345bc3b62e112aa7cd5eb1", "date": "2021-03-11", "hours": 2780, "content": "Absolute blast and I really enjoyed the combat.

That and the crashing problem but hopefully they can update it and fix that.  The game crashed for me about 10 times but luckily I didn't lose too much data.  Other than these two things, I really love this game!!  It is so much fun to play.  Just walking around and enjoying the scenery and the music is fun.  The fighting is also fun.  I'm still working on doing the extra stuff so I'm not completely finished yet but I have to say that I think this game is so awesome.  I was looking forward to playing it for the past couple of months and it did not disappoint in the least.  I did play Persona 5 a while ago so I know everyone well and it's really cool that they made this so that we can see them again.  Everyone is just as cool as they were before and there are a couple new characters who are also very cool.  The voice actors are all very good (I use the Japanese).  The graphics are also very good.  It's very shiny and bright.  Overall, I will give this game an A+++++.  I will keep at it until I get everything and then I'll probably start over.  I think it's nice that they give you the option to select your difficulty level.  Next time I play, I will try hard mode.  I don't suppose there is any chance of them making another sequel but I can dream.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Persona games.

You actually have to use your brain while playing. Also although not a turnbased game like mainline persona games, it translates the persona turn based elements very well in gun and skills.\n\nStory, so far characters have been great, entire cast is back, with 2 new main characters who are both interesting. Charters feel exactly as they should be and story is intriguing, and it's neat how with the jails it seems each jail owner didn't make it through desire, but trauma, so it makes the villans more interesting.\n\nAlso it's basically P52, which is funny because in one of the trailers a 2 almost appeared after the \"5\" and then \"S\" butted it out. It is a sequel.\n\nVisuals, Looks like a persona 5 game, but not only that the jail aspects are really polished, not only does each jail seem unique, the quality of the details is amazing. Other muso games seem to not care all that much, but this one just random buildings may have defined shops and markets or be their own specific thing. It's not just slightly different colors. Nor is it copy and paste. Though this does come at a cost. It's not one big map but many decent size areas per jail with load times. I'm on a gaming laptop and can run it at around 1.5 resolution, max graphical settings, 60 frames non combat(btw max cap is 60, so wait till someone mods it for that to change) which lowers to 40 in hectic combat(which I never actually notice, unless i'm looking at my fps number). I say all this is because between each area it's about 10-20 seconds. Which isn't short enough to ignore nor long enough to alt tab. This is my biggest complaint with the game and that's saying a lot. \n\nAll i can say is compared to muso games this is probably the best(although i've heard hyrule warriors was made by the same studio so maybe that's just as good) in every department.\n\nI would recommend buying this game at full price even if not a persona fan. \n\nNot a giant downside to me but the social life aspect is toned down a lot.

I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way.

Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes.

Nach knapp 40 Stunden ingame, denke ich, dass ich eine ziemlich allgemeine Meinung zu diesem Spiel abgeben kann, also tue ich dies nun:\nOb man denn nun ein Fan des Mouso-Kampfsystems ist, sei mal dahin gestellt, doch ich finde, dass dies perfekt zu dem Spiel passt und nicht \"erzwungen\" wirkt. Die K\u00e4mpfe sind flott, interessant und zumindest auf Schwer auch einigerma\u00dfen anspruchsvoll (habs nach ca. 10 Std Spielzeit von Normal auf Schwer umgestellt, da es mir zu leicht war). Das der Schwierigkeitsgrad f\u00fcr mich auch ein Negativpunkt ist, darauf komme ich sp\u00e4ter nocheinmal zur\u00fcck. Fahren wir erstmal mit dem Gameplay fort. Tja, Gameplay ist bei Persona Spielen ja so eine Sache... Obwohl man ganz klar sagen muss, dass die F\u00fclle an Dialogfeldern nicht ganz so ausufernd ist, wie im Hauptspiel oder in den vorigen Hauptspielen der Reihe. Das Gameplay ist ein weinig mehr im Vordergrund, vorallem in den Dungeons wird man nun nichtmehr mit Textnachrichten zugem\u00fcllt, die man sich schon 5 mal durchgelesen hat. So habe ich bisweilen das Gef\u00fchl gehabt, dass man ein wenig mehr Freiheit hat, mit dem was man tut. Und tun kann man \u00e4hnlich viel wie im Basis-Spiel: Einkaufen, Velvet-Room (Persona Fusion), Requests machen und Kochen (!). Allerdings sind auch einige Dinge gestrichen worden und damit meine ich vorallem die Confidants/Social Links. Da ich mich im Vorhinein nicht so mit dem Spiel im Detail besch\u00e4ftigt hatte (Spoiler dies das) kam diese \u00c4nderung dann schon ziemlich \u00fcberraschend. Statt dem bekannten Leveln der Freunde und Bekannten hat man nun eine Art Wertetabelle, die einem Buffs gibt wie bspw. st\u00e4rkere physische ANgriffe o.\u00c4. F\u00fcr diese \"Wertetabelle\" ben\u00f6tigt man Bindungs-Punkte, welche man als Belohnung durch erledigte Requests von Freunden oder einfach durch das Fortf\u00fchren der Hauptstory erh\u00e4lt. Ob dies einem gef\u00e4llt, muss ein jeder selber sagen, ich finds nicht schlecht, trotzdem bevorzuge ich lieber die guten alten Social Links.\nDa ich es eben gerade erw\u00e4hnt habe: Die Hauptstory! (No Spoiler)\nAls allererstes sei gesagt: Die Story hat nicht viel mit der von Persona 5 zutun, lediglich kleine ANspielungen und Namen werden beil\u00e4ufig erw\u00e4hnt. Im Grunde kann dieses Spiel also auch von Leuten gespielt werden, die Persona 5 im Original nicht gespielt haben. Trotzdem rate ich, dies getan zu haben, da es ansonsten ein wenig Verwirrung geben k\u00f6nnte, insofern man der SMT-Reihe gegen\u00fcber fremd ist.\nEs ist also eine komplett neue und eigene Story, mit einer deutlich k\u00fcrzeren Spielzeit als die des Originals.\nWelche von beiden nun besser ist, kann ich nicht beurteilen, da ich das Spiel (wie gesagt) noch nicht beendet habe, trotzdem finde ich, dass die Strikers Story interessant ist und mir pers\u00f6nlich unter Umst\u00e4nden vielleicht auch ein wenig besser gef\u00e4llt als die von Persona 5. Aber gut, das ist Nebensache.\nKommen wir zur Technik, ehe ich auf die Negativpunkte eingehe: Das Spiel ist sch\u00f6n... Es ist wirklich sch\u00f6n. Zwar nichts was dich r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts vom Stuhl haut, aber durch glatte Kanten, gute Lichteinstrahlungen und sch\u00f6ne Charaktermodelle (zumindest in n\u00e4herer Distanz!) sieht das Spiel ziemlich gut aus. Die Framerate ist allerdings, zumindest auf meinem PC, hier und da ein wenig inkonstant, pendelt immer zwischen 40 und 60 FPS, je nachdem, wie Effektgeladen die Combo nun einmal ist. Bisher haben mich diese Drops allerdings \u00fcberhaupt nicht gest\u00f6rt, ich hatte fast dauerhaft eine zufriedenstellende Framerate und kann mich dessen nicht beklagen. Wenns nicht l\u00e4uft, dann sollte man halt an den Einstellungen rumspielen.\nSo, nun noch ein paar Mankerl, die das Spiel eben so hat im Schnelldurchlauf:\n1. Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob es an meinen Kopfh\u00f6rern liegt, aber ich finde, dass das Spiel an einigen Stellen eine extrem leise (englische) Vertonung hat. Einige W\u00f6rter werden quasi gefl\u00fcstert und wen dar\u00fcber dann irgendein Soundtrack l\u00e4uft, der im schlimmsten Fall so gut ist, dass man mitsummt, dann kann man nunmal nicht mehr so richtig h\u00f6ren, was Yusuke denn so von sich gibt. Und es ist nichtnur bei ihm so. Dieser Fehler k\u00f6nnte allerdings auch einfach an mir liegen.\n2. Abst\u00fcrze: Ich hatte bisher 3. Einen direkt am ANfang des Spiels nach der ersten halben Stunde circa (ohne zwischendrin Speichern zu k\u00f6nnen) und 2 dann zwischendurch. Ist zwar vielleicht etwas doof, aber mich haben sie nicht gest\u00f6rt, da sie an Stellen kamen, an denen Crashes nicht allzu schlimm w\u00e4ren.\n3. Levelkurve/Schwierigkeitsgrad: Wie am Anfang geschrieben, habe ich das Spiel auf Normal begonnen und bin kl\u00e4glich im ersten Dungeon verzweifelt. Du hast einen Kampf gemacht, 2 Mal dein Persona angreifen lassen und die SP waren weg. Dieses Problem zog sich bis zum ANfang den 2. Dungeons, denn auf einmal kamst du durch den gesamten Dungeon, ohne einmal SP nachzustocken (mit denselben SP-Ausgaben wie im ersten!) Dies f\u00fchrte dann dazu, dass ich auf Schwer gewechselt habe und nun eine gute Balance zwischen dem bekannten SMT- Schwierigkeitsgrades und einem frustfreien Spielen empfinde. Zwar gibt es hier und da kleine Passagen wo die Entwickler ein wenig \u00fcbertrieben haben (ja, ich meine dich und deine Hacking-Fights Futaba!), aber alles in allem gebe ich die Empfehlung dieses Spiel auf Schwer zu spielen. Achja, dazu kommt, dass ich wirklich wenig erfahrung mit Mouso-Games im Vorraus hatte.\n4. Ist dies ein Persona-Spiel? Mein letzter (und gr\u00f6\u00dfter) Kritikpunkt geht an die Neuerungen des Spieles, mit denen alte Traditionen gebrochen wurden. Und bevor ich ein paar davon aufz\u00e4hle muss ich einmal erw\u00e4hnen, dass ich s\u00e4mtliche \u00c4nderungen gar nicht so negativ sehe sondern die Innovation darin erkenne und es als das Prinzip in einem Spin-Off anerkenne.\nAlso: Keine Social-Links, stattdessen \"Bindungsleiste\", keine Zeiteinteilung (ja richtig gelesen, es sind festgeschriebene Tage, man muss nicht inerhalb eines Zeitraums einen Dungeon gecleart haben, zum Teil recycleter Soundtrack (\u00fcberhaupt nicht schlimm xD)\n... Mehr will ich hier jetzt nicht schreiben.\n\nSchlusseindlich sieht man glaube ich, dass Persona 5 Strikers unter Umst\u00e4nden ein sehr kontroverses Spiel sein kann, doch mir macht es Spa\u00df so wie es ist und ich kann es absolut jedem empfehlen, der Persona 5 gespielt hat. Spielt dieses Spiel, genie\u00dft Gameplay und Story und bildet euch eure eigene Meinung.\nIch habe hier jetzt alles gesagt, was ich als wichtig anerkenne und kann dieses Spiel nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen.

Tout cela est un peu confus, surtout pour les joueurs voulant essayer d'aborder l'histoire de P5S sans conna\u00eetre P5. Disons-le tout net, si vous \u00eates dans ce cas de figure, vous n'appr\u00e9cierez pas ce jeu \u00e0 sa juste valeur.\n\nEn effet, P5S est un bon jeu avant tout gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son univers et ses personnages. Sans rentrer dans les d\u00e9tails, cette histoire tourne autour d'un road trip du protagoniste et de son \u00e9quipe afin d'enqu\u00eater sur des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes similaires \u00e0 ceux rencontr\u00e9s durant leur aventure pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il est donc presque indispensable de conna\u00eetre cette derni\u00e8re pour reconna\u00eetre les diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, clins d'oeil et autres easter eggs. Le sc\u00e9nario est suffisamment bon (bien qu'un peu pr\u00e9visible) pour qu'il tienne sur ses deux jambes. Toutefois, ce sont surtout les personnages (protagonistes comme antagonistes) qui permettent \u00e0 ce jeu de prendre son envol. Mention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 Sophia et Zenkichi, qui sont admirablement \u00e9crits.\n\nLe gameplay s'adresse \u00e0 bien plus de joueurs que le sc\u00e9nario. Bien que beaucoup de m\u00e9caniques sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en m\u00eame temps et qu'il est difficile de ma\u00eetriser tous les personnages, les combats restent suffisamment lisibles pour que le joueur moyen ne se perd pas. Il est toujours possible d'arr\u00eater le temps pour se soigner ou consulter les forces et faiblesses des ennemis les plus proches, permettent d'\u00e9valuer la meilleure strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 adopter. L'IA des partenaires est d\u00e9cente (reste en vie longtemps et fait des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts acceptables tout en aidant \u00e0 quelques reprises avec des buffs et des soins) sans \u00eatre extr\u00eamement efficace. Il est \u00e9galement possible (et m\u00eame recommand\u00e9) de jouer tous les personnages afin de profiter de la meilleure exp\u00e9rience de jeu. De plus, il est toujours possible de se replier \u00e0 partir d'un point de sauvegarde pour souffler et prendre tout son temps dans quelques petites zones des diff\u00e9rentes villes du jeu. Pour autant, ce jeu n'est pas facile et plusieurs phases (dont la plupart des boss) s'av\u00e8rent fortement coriaces.\n\nNiveau musique, les amateurs de P5 restent en terrain connu, puisque de nombreuses musiques du jeu d'origine sont pr\u00e9sentes, souvent remix\u00e9s mani\u00e8re rock. C'est toujours une r\u00e9ussite, en particulier avec  \"Blooming villain\". Les nouvelles musiques, comme celles des nouvelles villes sont tr\u00e8s belles. Coup de coeur au th\u00e8me (et \u00e0 ses variations) de Sophia \"Heart of an IA\".\n\nL\u00e0 o\u00f9 le bas blesse surtout, c'est niveau graphismes et portabilit\u00e9. Le jeu n'est pas vraiment beau et n\u00e9cessite sur des ordinateurs n'\u00e9tant pas des b\u00eates de course de tourner au minimum. C'est juste mal optimis\u00e9. J'ai rencontr\u00e9 de nombreux ralentissement, crashs et autres probl\u00e8mes de lancement, au point de devoir r\u00e9installer le jeu en entier pour pouvoir y rejouer apr\u00e8s un bug particuli\u00e8rement coriace. Si en plus de \u00e7a vous comptez le fait que les joueurs de Switch ayant Smash/PS4 gamers ayant P5 ou P5R ont des bonus musicaux, vous comprendrez que le portage PC n'est pas franchement int\u00e9ressant.\n\nBref, un tr\u00e8s bon jeu, bien que s'adressant \u00e0 un public restraint pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire des compromis techniques. Je le recommande malgr\u00e9 tout sur PC.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "626bf6c7eb6b59b783155d713e0ab0b7", "author": "01e55f93c25e58fd9a3ef0ea8c7856ca", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 3055, "content": "If you play this game, your chances of having sex will increase.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eb754d5f2d205474bb2be99b0baa7a8f", "author": "ec592e89387d5d7ead42634c468d45a9", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 4686, "content": "good\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d0c8a84a33c25336a2dee5bf75cdfb43", "author": "e6f8e6418cb8517289e9879a21712247", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 3401, "content": "i got this game on ps4 first, loved it, got the platinum trophy, i still wanted to play it more so i bought it on steam and got all the achievements...  there is a switch version too...", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c83f028253d256649cbebc1dac960606", "author": "6de06ce084dc5ac2bcf048f47dddf892", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 2870, "content": "You're a real surprise, Joker\u2026", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "18565f73207d5f569eb9c02ff5ef5fd3", "author": "b215bd3ff0d45a80939233a26a590277", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 6799, "content": "its persona , add dynasty warriors/kingdom hearts game play and delete the high school sim and you got strikers.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c859e006e6a35f2da802baeb9f98deae", "author": "3b2ad63a33c75be9967db16a5d6e2843", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 1509, "content": "P5S \u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "26c4f73d6f8d5b8ab7d581caf359e9fa", "author": "aa1f659ec1a952d3bd9361f1b47c83bb", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 5677, "content": "A este momento no me e terminado de pasar el juego llevo unas 17 horas jugadas y por lo menos a mi se me hizo muy buen juego, yo me esperaba algo mas de como un estilo de combate por turnos pero el estilo de combate se me hace muy entretenido al principio me costo un poco progresar mas que nada por el dinero pero entre mas avanzo menos me e preocupado, los jefes me han gustado mucho aunque solo e peleado conta dos y los considero restantes aunque no demaciado si vas bien surtido de curas esto por lo menos en la dificultad normal, en cuanto a la historia hasta el momento me a encantado y tengo muchas curiosidad en saber como finalizara, en canto a bugs a mi no me a tocado encontrarme con uno el unico problema por asi decirlo que e visto seria que el estilo de visualisacion se me cambia solo aveces de pantalla completa a ventana.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "433eaedb0c5e5305886b4d56efa9f267", "author": "7b10bd40076c56298ac3a5351e5dcffc", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 5719, "content": "Persona 5 Royal por favorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Atlussssssssssssssss", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "07f78b47d4c0556ea3faea1443c2b8d6", "author": "dc1e49cbcc3a563098a8ef6f1ede62a6", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 6488, "content": "Hifumi WHERE are you!!", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 38, "funny": 11, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6416bda84b5458f1a4fc7612ef0582a9", "author": "8d35549a084657c3bb3e658ba2ee7c2b", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 1946, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers expands on the already-enjoyable journey that was Persona 5/Royal, and does so without the parts that made the previous game annoying (time-limited story arcs, individual character social development, turn-based combat, etc.).

Die passenden Worte fehlen mir daf\u00fcr. F\u00fcr die Persona 5 Reihe empfinde ich so viel Liebe. Alle 3 sind einfach gro\u00dfartige Spiele, welche mich von der ersten Minute an gefesselt haben. Wenn ich bedenke mit wie viel Skepsis ich damals an Persona ran getreten bin.. Und auf was f\u00fcr eine Reise mich es am Ende mitgenommen hat. All die Charaktere, seien es die Phantom Thieves oder andere Confidants, sind mir so an's Herz gewachsen. Ich habe Strikers ziemlich entgegen gefiebert!\n\nAlles ab hier k\u00f6nnte jetzt Spoiler enthalten, daher warne ich euch hier explizit. \n\nAlso, ein paar (hoffentlich) kurze Worte zu Strikers: Wer das \u00fcbliche rundenbasierte Persona erwartet, vergesst es. Hier haben wir ein Echtzeit-Kampfsystem, wo du auf Horden einpr\u00fcgelst und \u00f6fters mal dein Leben aus den Augen verlierst, wenn du nicht jemanden der Heilen kann im Team hast. Hei\u00dft, kein unn\u00f6tiges Panik schieben ob die SP reicht bis zum Ende, weil ohne kannst du dich schlecht heilen. Keine Items mehr daf\u00fcr horten, was nicht hei\u00dft, dass sie ganz nutzlos jetzt sind. Du kannst verschiedene Angriffe starten, hast weiterhin mehrere Persona und kannst Gef\u00e4ngnisse erforschen. Von den guten alten Schl\u00f6ssern k\u00f6nnt ihr Abschied nehmen in dem Teil. \nDie Grafik ist genau das was wir gew\u00f6hnt sind, was auch gut so ist! Die Musik \u00e4hnelt sehr der Alten, wurde jedoch Stellenweise gut erneuert bzw etwas ver\u00e4ndert. Allein wenn ich an die Musik im Okinawa Gef\u00e4ngnis denke.. Uff, Hallo G\u00e4nsehaut!\nDas Zeitmanagement ist endlich kein Kampf mehr gegen das gef\u00fchlte taktische Denken. Was machst du jetzt? Stats verbessern, Confidants erh\u00f6hen oder doch ins Mementos gehen? Hier reist du einfach nur mit deinen Freunden, kannst zwischendurch mal Quest's f\u00fcr sie erledigen oder kleine Events mit ihnen machen. Dazu hast du so viel Zeit wie du willst f\u00fcr die Gef\u00e4ngnisse. Gehst du einmal raus, vergeht kein Tag automatisch. \nDie gesamte Story.. Sie ist gro\u00dfartig. Ich hatte so oft G\u00e4nsehaut und habe mitgef\u00fchlt. Man lernt viele Dinge dazu, andere Ansichten. Und so dumm es auch klingt, du hast jemanden an deiner Seite, der lernt was ein Herz eigentlich ist. Es gibt wieder verstecke Nachrichten in diesem Spiel, welche man wirklich gut verinnerlichen kann. \n\nBisher habe ich Strikers auf der Ps4 durch gesuchtet. Mit 43 Stunden habe ich es beendet und bin noch dabei die 100% zu machen, welche mir hier auch noch bevor stehen. Es sind jetzt nicht unbedingt die knapp 80/90 Stunden die man sonst gewohnt ist, aber ich finde man kommt komplett auf seine Kosten bei diesem Teil. Ich denke Persona 5 hat f\u00fcr immer einen besonderen Platz in meinem Herzen und ich lasse mich \u00fcberraschen ob nicht vielleicht noch etwas von den Phantom Thieves kommen wird. <3 Zumindest m\u00f6chte ich noch keinen Abschied von der bunten Truppe nehmen.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3cde0306539f5362ab4fe9c69afa3590", "author": "59191386fa2655f3906abaff0a770b44", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 2752, "content": "Great follow up to Persona 5/5R .

Standalone, the most glaring thing is you're dropped straight in assuming you already understand Persona 5's plot. While I feel like you would enjoy the game regardless, I highly recommend visiting the first Persona 5 game. If you're in a pinch, watch a playthough or in the worst case scenario the anime (though not very well received.)\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI have had numerous crashes since the early release day and to my knowledge there is no fix yet, which is a little off-putting. If you do decide to get this game for PC, please practice good saving habits if only for this reason. Save as often as possible, as this game does *not* autosave. While I still enjoyed the experience overall, the crash issue made me wish I got it for console instead. There are also a few game-breaking bugs which you will have to avoid. For example, you cannot play in fullscreen or borderless windowed modes or the game will go into a black screen if you trigger a cutscene. You must play in windowed mode as far as  my experience has shown me.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay combines aspects of Persona 5's JRPG elements and combat, with musou mechanics you're probably familiar with most \"Warriors\" games. While it has its flaws, I never found myself bored. Fights felt interesting, though sometimes downright easy playing on \"Normal.\"\n\nAs a note to Atlus, you've got to be more timely with bug-fixes and more courteous to your PC audience if you want to keep going with this PC release approach. At the very least keep some sort of communication with the player base acknowledging the issues.\n\nSTORY:\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of the original Persona 5. It does not take into consideration your past romance(s?) or confidants, nor can I say it makes any clear reference to the events of Persona 5 Royal. You may notice some themes being reused in the first few levels of the game that are similar to Persona 5's palace themes. I will say, however, that they are distinct enough to not feel like a rehash. The antagonists feel unique, and contrast heavily from the precursor of this game. \n\nOverall, without giving anything away, while the writing is definitely not as good as before it's pleasant for those already familiar with the first game, showing strong character growth in contrast and an interesting new evil to take on. I personally believe this is a worthy sequel story-wise.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nI'm hoping the glitches are resolved for the PC release at some point. That said, I can comfortably recommend this game to people who are itching for more of the Phantom Thieves adventures, those looking to beat up massive hordes of shadows, or even if you're really weird and want to get introduced to Persona 5 with this game! I'm giving the game a thumbs up, but begrudgingly so in light of the current state of the PC release. But for my purposes, this game was worth the occasional crash and being forced to play in Windowed mode.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7158209480b35372a017d021d0373052", "author": "7be6a15789a2504f8e0f9215ea2a9ec1", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 611, "content": "Good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c6229a79579550c19197ce1e9b768cef", "author": "81646dd61a8f573088525ffcb8aa7de0", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 2133, "content": "good story, great gameplay, bangin music\n\nit do kinda slap tho", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4e87cb37eb775015a62caa03e44f16e2", "author": "7b9b5f4c677550dc9fd7bdbd3ce07aab", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 4578, "content": "stop portbegging\n\np5 is not going to the switch", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2b32fce78d805dbba3b0eaf2b9be63d0", "author": "2961ee8026e15ddfba583eeb2a9f3533", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 7598, "content": "very fun has funnys and has nonfunnys but more funny than everything else and very good game", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a8603bedbdfd5e42861d8fb67a024aea", "author": "5570c8a7d3a7560fb6d28ebb22a8d11c", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 3193, "content": "its sick\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "efbbcdab391b5f058553471e6c9df881", "author": "ad50c71e17b9549290670998c9167613", "date": "2021-03-08", "hours": 3223, "content": "The story and dialogue is just as lovable as P5.

I LOVED P5 on the PlayStation 4 (didn't play P5R yet, ATLUS, PLS BRING IT ON PC, I BEG YOU) and I do love P5Strikers even more, kinda. Although I couldn't build my romance-ship with Futaba, like in P5...\n\nThe gameplay is in my opinion not just like a normal ''Warriors''-Hack and Slash-kinda gameplay, it is basically a combination of using your Persona-Skills correctly or in the right situation and more or less just smashing your 2 attack-buttons. For those, who like the ''Warriors''-games, you will DEFINITELY love this piece of indescribable and beautiful art. The ''Hack and Slash''-Combat doesn't feel boring nor repetitive, like in the original ''Warriors''-series, which is because of the HUGE variety of Personas you can have (just like in the original P5) and how ATLUS/Koei Tecmo/Omega-Force integrated the usage of the Personas, is just awesome.\n\nThe story is just awesome. No worries, I won't say ANYTHING about the story. It plays half a year after the story of P5 and  has a lot of moments, where it brings you to almost crying, but it can INSTANTLY change your sad mood into a very happy mood, because of a sudden joke or such little things, which make the story, the characters and their bond just absolutely amazing and wonderful. Speaking of the characters, each of the already known Phantom Thieves and all of the new characters newly introduced to this story are completely well written, each has their own little ''story'' and ''highlight'' in this game - Atlus, you are just amazing in writing characters and stories for your games.\n\nWhat else can I say? I am again cmpletely amazed because of an Atlus-game, which isn't anything special, because, as I've said, Atlus is absolutely A M A Z I N G in writing stories + characters.\n\nEvery city, that you will see is individually designed, nothing looks like the other, the Meta-Verse is truly amazing designed, the bosses all have great designs and I can not stop simping about this game (or Futaba, heh).\n\nI hope for everyone, who will read this, that I could help you a little bit, if you have troubles, buying this game, because you needed a second opinion. <3\n\nOh, two things left....\n1. FUTABA IS WAIFU, FUTABA FOR LAIFU <3\n\n2. ATLUS - PLEASE - PERSONA 5 ROYAL FOR PC AND MAKE AGAIN A SEQUEL FOR THE BEST PHANTOM THIEVES ON THE EARTH!!!!!\n\nP.S.: Sorry for my bad english, couldn't decide, if I should write this review on English or German, so yeah xD\n\nEdit: I give this game a 10/10. Loved it. Always will love it. <3", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "92543c9435e651728935a6a1c42ea5e7", "author": "30b79fb54fc25393aa947c0ff8a29aaa", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 1631, "content": "This is not a cheap muosu games where you just slash everyone with no story or anything. I bought this game expecting the game to be like all the muosu games where there is a big roster and map and you just beat the crap out of everyone\n\nfirst hour into the game I found it is completely different. The combat mechanics is the same but this is still a persona game with almost all the elements from the previous persona 5 game. there are still lovely conversations between the thieves and the side stories like dining out or going on a stroll . \n\nIn the battles you can use the normal combat system from muosu games but also the persona skills. When in combat if you are any of the thieves you can use their personas skills to deal elemental or physical damage and if you are playing as the Joker, you can pick any persona you have and use their skills. You can obtain personas by chance if they drop a mask if you defeat them. You can also create personas by fusing other personas. \n\nPersona 5 had confidants level where you can increase their level by interacting with each person but in this game, they introduced bond level instead. Any interaction with the phantom thieves increases the bond bar. with every level you get 3 bond points that you can spend on any skill you would like. There are many skills t obtain and the skills itself can be leveled up so thats a great way if you want to focus on magic boosts or like healing bonuses and any different build you think of . \n\nif you enjoyed persona 5, you will enjoy this 100% . don't take this game as cheap muosu game, its another persona 5 game but with real time combat instead of turn base. I am currently 13 hours in the game and just finished the first chapter of the game and starting the second one. 50$ for this game is great price for what the game has to offer. \n\n100% recommend this game", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6fe40debce9855758070633ff4a6b734", "author": "4a3708166bd55890afdc8ba4d658ffb4", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 2687, "content": "Es jodidamente divertido.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9dbb26640dd655f59c8718456e38505b", "author": "a63e0edd87fe5334b8ac723d09106088", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 5279, "content": "They gave Joker from smash his own game.", "comments": 7, "source": "steam", "helpful": 456, "funny": 530, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6844712cc22553faadea937ce0096c4f", "author": "8250e0ae17e35f698cf3f612b40789e4", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 1539, "content": "Now with 10 percent more anime!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e20faa44b09f52e7939bedb174f112b7", "author": "e6db6b5abfab54d3b07847804b93d880", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 4141, "content": "good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9697aed848c7572286da0eb81e5a2fec", "author": "b18f632862825b04b0081e31bda7eb89", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 640, "content": "game crashes constantly", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "34d5fb5ba37753d0b11ec01adfa5e67b", "author": "4d48ea6a27a95cb59cbe9346f0faa566", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 2600, "content": "Only for people who played Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "edfb1a0ebb6a57a4b7f71724a8efc931", "author": "e95d492c7a1a5f41b0c87b92ef3bd661", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 3589, "content": "Great game, great story.

For those wondering this game has a lot of dialogue so far, my first 2.5 hours were spent in dialogue, the rest in running around and fighting. \n\nThe soundtrack is essentially the same, if not slightly tweaked and revamped from P5 which already had a kick-ass soundtrack. Controls are easy to get accustomed to (on an actual controller and not my KBM). \n\nDo be warned, from what I read before I purchased this game the default, out of the box AA sucks and it's best to use your GPU's settings to force a better AA. Also for those that have anything north of a 60hz monitor it won't do you any good, this game is capped at 60 FPS, but I don't think this game is too terribly difficult to run. My 5700XT/3600x with everything maxed out in-game, and in the GPU control panel I'm easily getting a constant 60 FPS. \n\nThe combat is fluid, no hiccups, stutters, nada just hack away and have fun.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b5db9b9cade05d1b8377ff50d61c8e5a", "author": "f1d7dbcc2ad851bba56c7ced7e4392cf", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 3243, "content": "Sadly I can't recommend this at present.\n\nBut first, before getting to the very specific reasons why, some of the many positives:\n[list]\n[*]It's by far the best Warriors-type game out there. The idea to just fully remove the big mass combat maps sounds crazy and like it would completely break such a game, but it turns out it does just the opposite, it makes the combat able to use far more abilities and intricacies because there's only 20-30 enemies now, not 400-1000.\n[*]Persona 5 oozed style at every corner, and this carries the torch perfectly. Even the menus are - once again - overstylized to hell and back, the game is full of fancy animations, all fitting the theme.\n[*]Speaking of theme, wow the audio is even better than P5 or P5R. It really raises the bar for such games.\n[*]Combat is surprisingly challenging depending on difficulty chosen, because counters, interactions and avoidance have a lot of meaning and you can die in 2-3 hits if you use the wrong character at the wrong moment.\n[*]The story - as far as I can tell yet - is quite good, and easily blows anything any Warriors game has done before out of the water.\n[/list]\n\nSo, why no recommendation? Well, there's the problem that a significant amount of people experience quite frequent crashes to desktop. Sure, most games exhibit these for some hardware configurations but here it seems more that a majority see them, most people just rather rarely. And some people see them a lot. Also from reports around the web it seems those who have the accidentally released denuvoless version installed do [b]not[/b] suffer from these crashes. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is: You may want to hold off until they patch out Denuvo.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 18, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id":

fool!\n\nAt the time I'm writing this review we don't even have an announcement, BUT we have Strikers.\n\nFirst of all I want to clarify something, I played Persona 5 Royal and I know the story that brings our beloved group of Phantom Thieves to the events of this story but you don't need to play P5 to understand this story.\nActually many things change and in the game there are only some quotes that remind to Persona 5.\nThe only thing missing (for obvious reasons) is the developement of the characters that were already in Persona 5.\n\nBut after this introducion, how is the game?\nGood I should say, at first it seems like the cheap copy of Persona 5 (at least to me) because of many small differences, but in reality this game has an identity of It's own and It's a pretty one.\n\nThe biggest thing that changes from P5 is the gameplay, It's not a Jrpg and It's not turn based, this is actually a mousou, so you have lot of action packed in large areas with inhuman quantities of enemies.\n\nThe combat is imo well structured and well made, this results in a very fun to play experience, not too easy not too difficult.\nSpeaking of difficulty and levels of it, they are more or less the same as P5, the game doesn't change but the damage you and your enemies deal changes, it means that sometimes to pass throught some areas or bosses you might need to tryhard, but it's doable and, as I said before, in a pretty fun way.\n\nI won't get into the story but I really apprecitated Zenkichi and Sophie, they're pretty good characters :)\nOverall I just enjoyed the story ^^\n\n\nThis thing is getting longer than I first thought so let's go very quickly.\nThe game runs wery well and It's not that demanding but I encountered 3 crashes so make sure to save a lot.\nThe ost is just incredible, every song comes at the right time and every song is so good imo (I kinda looped this ost for a while and It's so good).\n\nSo in the end, this is a very good game but it may be not worth 60\u20ac for someone, if you like Persona and action stuff, I think you'll like this one.\n\nVote? Nah, It's just a very good game ^^", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f4d75cef13a953839b700c9ccae83480", "author": "275446ea0bfb578b857fa7e9e1c5f646", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 3481, "content": "1 Freakin minute in it and i cant stop dancing. \nThey actually kept the style and magic of persona 5 / Royal.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d3257c95b18f51589ed1f8ed0abf8465", "author": "1ca76bd585045ceba6778cc89c635b58", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 3706, "content": "Ryuuji finally says the F word", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 791, "funny": 306, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "860ce7cb42d45d7d8124f598e5d82f32", "author": "7f1db9ed2662557ebef3fd90b0f525a5", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 955, "content": "Ok, first of all i give a thumb up just because there isn't a mixed option.\nThe game itself is really good, the gameplay is basically a Musou like any other but with a persona flavour to it, so if you're into that kind of gameplay it's your stuff (also if you're a fan of persona, then you'll enjoy the artwork, soundtrack and characters).\nBut there's a huge but coming from a long fan of the series: the whole social, life and dating sim part is totally missing, no romances, no socialing, nothing that literally made the Persona franchise what it is, i guess that the game also is named Strikers, but that doesn't mean that you should completely remove 50% of the game.\nI'll give the game a 7 out of 10 just because of that!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9df451d226d45a6cb788840d263b9512", "author": "8ddc710fe45f5372aee908d6eb28607f", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 3810, "content": "An absolute joy to play!

Get this.  Never played Persona 5?  Probably not for you.\n\nIf you've played Persona 5 and are on the fence about this because of it being Dynasty Warriors combat, take the plunge.\n\nThe combat is actually way more Persona than I expected.  In fact, for difficult fights I spent way more time hitting the Persona button, exploiting weaknesses, switching characters to heal/buff, etc.  In any event, as someone who usually really doesn't care for DW, I found the combat in the game pretty enjoyable.  The dungeons were at least as interesting as anything P5 was doing, too.\n\nUnlike typical DW games, the draw here is the story.  This one is a direct story sequel to the Persona 5.  If you liked that story and want to just hang out with the dudes again on a road trip around Japan doing Phantom Thieves stuff, then play this game.  You don't get the time management social game from the mainline Persona games, but you get a full-fledged, consistent with Persona 5, sort of on-rails story.  It's really solid.\n\nOne other thing that I didn't really expect, the general presentation of the game is also pretty consistent with the quality of Persona 5.  The wild animations, menus, punk rock aesthetic, the music, voice acting... it's all here and it's very much a continuation of what P5 had going on.\n\nAll that said, with how much time and energy is spent on a story that assumes you played Persona 5, even if you really dig the combat for it's own sake, this is only really for people who have played and finished P5.  The story here is good, but it does not at all stand on its own 2 feet.  Tons of references to the events of P5 and definitely an assumption that you're already familiar with the cast.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7bee9410255955bb814df872c2083190", "author": "bf522853d14356dba7e470422aebdb95", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 444, "content": "Good good.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "feee50588aa351e98c15e80f199bd0a7", "author": "4b078010e97f525aab22c147b0ee0310", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 2510, "content": "\uc7ac\ubc0b\uc74c", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "16ee6004c70b5b9cae58dae243b28e17", "author": "f5d23cb466b85e5e9bd58541a164c9fa", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 4934, "content": "Not Persona 5.

And even if it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, I'll definitely update the game to recommend it if they at least fix the loading/crashing issues.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f1e83a74979c5945ac6c9d754e49844c", "author": "0746bf5b27ed5ec8af62af5daca1a780", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 25, "content": "No UWS support.

This being said I won't be softening any criticisms below whats here is a genuine face value of the game.\n\nAnimation, story, and interaction\n-This game is purely more persona 5 with it's character interactions. Given there is no confidant system or romance options, so waifu wars don't work here, but if you enjoyed the casual phantom thief bits from persona 5 this is a treat.\n-The music is purely high quality stuff, mostly all of the new tracks written for this game sound great. From the first prison's music to the final bosses it's all persona standards, and even if you aren't a fan of it, the game allows any persona music to be the main soundtrack.\n-Most of the animations are pretty well done, primarily the new showtime special attacks are beautifully done, each character has their own unique animation matching their personality. Honestly Joker has the most basic sadly because of his many persona options.\n\nThe Gameplay    \n Perspective of a playthrough on hard first time using a ps4 controller via an xbox controller layout\n\nFrankly I love the combat style of this game, it advertises itself as being a hack in slash, which by technicality is true. Coming from a hard difficulty perspective, I entirely believe that hard is the best way for this game to be experienced. \nBasic attacks and combos --- Basic attacking is unique to each character however they all share similarities. Combos are all simple at face value being either   X-Y    X-X-Y     or   X-X-X-Y                 but they can get depth from stringing them together, but what makes the combo system unique is how each of those inputs will cast a persona skill, whether it be a buff, debuff, or skill. These combos likewise use no precious sp, so in longer fights they are instrumental so that joker doesn't develop magic dysfunction as the boss pulls out a second health bar. \n\nMore advanced unique movesets ---  each character has specially made attack animations and mechanics and I will attempt to list them here without any spoilers. Some overlap but that's to be expected\nJoker- has a basic dagger gun moveset based around getting quick persona combos\nRyuji- focuses on charged hits that deal incredible damage, and can prevent staggering with a self buff\nAnn- Can imbue her whip with fire that allows her to deal with an enemies weakness from basic attacks\nMorgana- simple normal moveset, becomes car for special moveset. nuff said\nYusuke- Is based around unique combo counts, where Y activates a parry frame, and if successful he can add more hits to a combo counter\nHaru- Purely aoe strength, her persona combo strikes are large and lingering and all of her hits are powerful\nMakota-buffs her large combo attacks with nuclear, uses johana to ride down enemies with X-X-X-Y\nFutaba has the same role to the point of redundancy. The largest change is the added support where she increases showtime gauges\n\nCounterstrikes\nNot only is this my favorite track in the game against japanese ironman lol, but it is a skill in the new bond system that I quite like. This skill means any last minute dodges allow the character to immediately retaliate with a persona attack. Get this skill immediately it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThief dash aka area hopscotch \n-dash to a piece of scenery and interact with it dealing damage of a certain type. Honestly I really like this system, I like the little differences in character the interactions show, and it gives the player more control over the terrain. All bosses use the interaction really neatly as well with the least creative being the final boss who I won't spoil\n\nOkay now time for the nitpicks\nThe slightly bad \n\nSpammed with tutorials at the beginning - LIKE DEAR GOD the first few hours of the game you won't escape these things. It's like they were stalking me waiting to pop out from a corner EXCUSE ME SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT BURN. Like they serve a purpose but if you already know how the status works from persona 5 you will get annoyed fast. Doesn't help that they give you messages about EVERY character when you switch to them, which playing all of them from the beginning, it gets irritating fast.\n\nThe game always has you fighting with 3 other ai controlled phantom thieves unless you take them off of your party, and I would discourage doing this. Usually the ai are protected from their own stupidity by generous I frames and resistance to attacks, and they seem to avoid using sp..........Unless they are healing\n               \nHOWEVER, some times the ai just get in your way, they will die like idiots and leave you fighting alone, just because the game didn't save them. Like for instance, and I'll avoid spoilers, but one boss creates stupid walls of lasers to hit you, and these things move incredibly slowly. I'd have to drop my controller on the floor to get hit by these things, but the ai will not avoid them. They don't understand that the back of the platform is the only safe spot so they stand there and get whacked. It's honestly infuriating.\n\n-So this is a genuine problem but a strange one. So this game lacks all interaction with side characters who weren't phantom thieves, so there is no takemi or iwai in this game which is already pretty sad. Instead their shops are combined into a shop Sophie runs from wherever the thieves are at that moment. Now breaking the disbelief that sitting in the middle of an island a delivery could get there in a matter of moments, this shop seems like a good way to get the thieves items from anywhere. The problem lies in the amount you can buy, as the amount is always from 1-4 of an item, including healing(I think the most is a 120 heal later in the game which you can get 4 of at a time). Throughout the game this isn't an issue, it works well in fact to stop you from skyrim healing through every fight, BUT AT THE END, there is a gauntlet of tough refights with bosses as well as dangerous shadows for the postgame content. This practically requires decent health resources as well as sp items, but the only way to restock this dumb shop is by spending time in the metaverse, but not just that winning fights. That means you have to run through an area killing everything several times over to get the heath resources needed to beat some of this tough fights. The shop also contains incredibly rare cooking items, specifically that POS coffee bean that is never there but is needed for 2 post game special recipes, so get to grinding that last area. I swear if the enemies in that last area weren't pushovers to a grenade launcher I would have lost my sanity\n\n-This game has no Satanael. None of the awakened personas from persona 5 are here, every single member of the main cast has their originals, Morgana still has gorro, Ryuji still has captain kid, Ann has Carmen, Haru, has M'lady etc. It's pretty mentally annoying especially since Morgana HAD to become max rank as a confidant, and thus had to have an evolved persona.\n\nOkay THE REALLY BAD\n-The game has a bug where it softlocks after a particular boss...... This did not affect me but it is worth noting\n-There can be infinite loading screens........This did not affect me\n-The game doesn't start for some people\n- And finally the most annoying one, this thing crashes randomly in loading screens, and it's painful and this one did affect me. I had to live in fear half the time because I had made significant progress, and a visit to Lavenzia could outright delete that time spent. It was frankly awful and has not been patched as of this review.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3f26db8d1c315356af9aa1aa8da85f9f", "author": "13ec6db700145a769b2f09b111e7137b", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 5032, "content": "Great music as always, with classic remixes and top tier new tracks. Story is a little better than expected out of a spinoff game, though the fact there are no mentions of Royal content whatsoever is disappointing. The core gameplay is actually really fun and not as much of a deviation from traditional combat as you'd think, and it really highlights how cool the Phantom Thieves are meant to look when moving and fighting simultaneously as a team. The Personas available feel very limiting (especially the late game ones) but fusion is relatively in depth and fun to play with. The \"real life\" exploration is also constricted but the different settings the game takes place in are charming and nice to have to make the game feel more like a mainline title.\n\nMy only major complaint is the crashing, which is a complete pain in the ass in a game without autosave. Save often! Other than that, there are only a few small annoying issues, such as shop items having incredibly low stock, money being a major bottleneck even after 80 hours + full completion, way too many BOND skills, and Persona stat changes feeling useless.\nOverall, P5S is a fun game that Persona 5 fans will almost certainly have fun with.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b440ed0f598159eabdee9efd576e0ba0", "author": "ab929e20b4b05e35b4cc1c8588a9dcd2", "date": "2021-03-07", "hours": 4106, "content": "An amazing game through and through. I loved the story, the characters old and new, the English voice acting which I am so glad Atlus waited until the English cast finished their recording despite the pandemic (Taylor Harvey playing persona 5 strikers\u2019s Sophie is such a great fit).  Finally the message Persona 5 strikers delivers. From the start I had worries of it being very slow pace due to how it set up. But once it kicks in. Oh it kicks in all right.  \n\nAs for the gameplay. For me personally the warriors style game play does get a bit repetitive during the ending just spamming magic and just using sp items to do more magic rinse and repeat but as a Dynasty Warriors fan. It\u2019s just so much fun. I really enjoyed it and would recommend those who are fans of persona to try it out or those who are interested in the warriors famoula (just a warning might want to start on hard since normal feels far too easy). Sure it\u2019s not your jrpg but for the plot and message it brings. Persona 5 Strikers is really worth the pick up. \n\nFinished it with all achievement done and would do it again.

It's a fantastic follow up to vanilla Persona 5. And if you haven't had the chance to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then you can pretty much jump into this game semi-blind, there are a few things spoiled but nothing too major I'd say. I didn't think this game would be all that great when it was first announced but after playing it and beating it today, I can say it's a lot better than I anticipated. Especially as this is technically a spin-off. I can confidently say that this game is the best possible sequel to Persona 5 we could receive. Atlus and Koei Tecmo really out did themselves.\n\nThe combat/gameplay: Gone is the Confidant/Social Link system from previous main Persona games and in their stead comes a story progressed system. The game does not overload you with confidants and stats to raise (which in my opinion is a great thing!) as the game progresses with the story and doesn't move on until you're ready, so you can spend what would be considered two separate days in Persona 5 just grinding in the jails as Persona 5 Strikers will not move on until the next day until you're ready and have finished what you want for that day. Next are the Bond Skills. These essentially replace confidant abilities and offer so much variety in gameplay. You can invest your points into skills that: increase your health and sp (something I seriously recommend for later on in the game), allow you to crack open safes that contain decent loot, increase your physical and magical attacks, allow your allies to heal you from alignments, and more! These bond points are a welcomed feature in my eyes! Now for the big thing: the new combat system. I must say, I haven't played a warriors-styled game until now but I am pleasantly surprised with the results. Gone is the JRPG turn-based combat system. You now have to partake in essentially horde/wave battles, something I think fits the Persona series quite well. You get to wreak loads of havoc, unleashing powerful and swift attacks onto oncoming hoards of mindless shadows. I especially love how time freezes when you're using your personas, it gives you plenty of time to plan out your attacks and make sure you utilise the best skills possible. I really like the new combat system and honestly believe the Persona series should utilise this going forward. Showtime attacks are also a feature (I think I may prefer the Royal showtime attacks however), they don't do much damage initially to bosses later in the game, however there is a bond skill that increases the amount of damage that showtime attacks does (something I seriously recommend you invest your points in).\n\nNew Characters: I know for a fact I'm not the only one who wishes this game followed Royal's timeline rather than vanilla's, but the absence of Akechi and Sumire are made up for with the two new party members of this game: Sophia and Zenkichi. I can say without a doubt, these two characters are great additions, they're so comedic and powerful additions to the Phantom Thieves. If I'm being honest, I prefer how these two characters were handled and implemented into the story rather than how Atlus dropped the ball with Sumire in Royal. They flow really well into the story and their eventual arcs are intriguing all the way. Not to mention they provide a unique sense of freshness for the already established cast. All the characters work well off each other and you can tell they've grown even closer during Joker's six month absence. Sophia is a more cutesy addition whereas Zenkichi is the more comedic addition. As I have previously mentioned, both new characters are fantastic additions to the PT cast and I hope to see them return in an eventual Persona 5 Arena game or even another P5 related spin-off.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, no game is absolutely perfect, this game does have some striking (no pun intended) issues. The game crashed for me around three times in total, mainly during the end of the second jail, specifically when I had finished the trauma cell (so just be careful about that as you may experience this issue for yourself and lose some progress). Next is an issue where some of the keys decided to stop functioning. There is a simple fix for this issue: simply just press the windows key and go out the game and go right back in. Even though this was easy to fix, it was still a hindrance, especially as it happened during the final boss! Although this isn't an issue that has affected me, some people are reporting that some of the characters voice's differ in audio quality, I personally couldn't tell the difference and thought the audio sounded perfect for everyone. I do understand some people may be able to tell considering the voice lines were recorded at the actor's homes using a kit provided to them. But like I said, I couldn't tell the difference so it doesn't effect me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Finally, I bought the digital deluxe edition of this game so I could play it early, and my playtime ended in a whopping 60:04 hours. It took me a little longer than maybe some other players as I decided to really focus on the side requests/activities. I fought many bosses multiple times to grind for money and xp (I recommend the Seth fight if you want to farm an easy 10k xp) and just really focused on the requests (something I never expected I'd do). I also spent a lot of my time going for most of the achievements, some are locked behind Post-Game and NG+. I managed to get most achievements I wanted and they were actually fun to get, none of them were too annoying and required a lot of patience to get. So I'm sure trophy hunters will be pleased to here this. The story is phenomenal and really is Persona 5 2, I cannot recommend this game enough to existing Persona fans and newcomers to the series, if you want to experience something P5 related but can't get any of the main games, GET THIS ONE! It's such a joy to play thought, the characters, the world, the gameplay, and especially the music! Lyn and Lotus Juice once again knock it out of the park with the amazing songs that are in this game. I am leaving this game with some of my favourite Persona songs: songs such as Daredevil and Counterstrike are just phenomenal. If you haven't heard them yet I suggest looking them up on Youtube. I love, love, love, love this game's OST and think it's one of the best in the series (mainline and spin-offs included). If you're debating on purchasing this game, then as I die-hard Persona fan, I say go for it. Take the leap and just play this game. It's a wonderful experience. And whilst it may not be as long and as intricate as vanilla P5/Royal, it's still a fantastic experience even though it's half as long as vanilla P5. Definitely pick this game up. And I hope many more Persona games make their way to Steam so newcomers have more games to try to further push themselves into this fantastic series.\n\nScore: Pretty much expected if you've read all of my review so far but I'm going to give Persona 5 Strikers a perfect 10/10 (despite the cons I have previously listed). Please try this game if you ever get the chance it's an experience you do NOT want to miss. Thank you for reading my review and thank you to Atlus and Koei Tecmo for creating such a brilliant sequel to Persona 5.\n\n \n", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3235e26c783e5a7da998e3e7cc0099bd", "author": "667a1cef092550fca3a6d7715605ef2d", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 2319, "content": "perfectly captured P5 in an action game.

It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3bc6933b80b35d90ae549e46e00edd91", "author": "e2f1846f45e05026bd77e5cc0aa7fdc6", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 810, "content": "sure\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fcf7b272e32f51369436f28f7421e4cd", "author": "2e26be8897c35c64b253f0be201e147b", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 2619, "content": "My first mushou and a great complementary experiencie of Persona 5 royal.

Playing it feels like neither.\n\nCombat itself is similar to Dynasty Warriors but lacks the feeling of big epic battles. Instead of large scale battles you have fixed encounters as if you were exploring a palace in persona 5. The combat is supposed to be fast paced but a lot of the time you end up opening menus to cast spells or switch your persona.\n\nA lot of what you'd expect in a Persona game is here but parts of it feel empty and missing. You have most the systems you'd except like fusing and elemental weakness and resistances however there are no social links. In fact there's not much socializing at all in this game.\n\nThere's a bond meter with the Phantom Thieves as you play through the game and clear side quests but that's about it. If you were hoping to see a large cast of returning characters it's a bit disappointing. All the Phantom Thieves are here and I did get to go for ramen with Ryuji but personally I always found the non-playable characters more interesting.\n\nOverall the game feels very Persona lite, hits a lot of what I want but is unsatisfying in some ways. If you're looking for Persona 5-2 this is not that game. If you just want to hang out with the Phantom Thieves again this game scratches that itch.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c61a4d18c6df5b378b4bac2098b1fee2", "author": "af4fa3dbfdeb52f3877b6ca2533e79b3", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 386, "content": "You'll never see it coming!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "66fd0188dd845d338f02501ff6119a81", "author": "b67f930b6c195e42a2a41e2f12a10f3b", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 6043, "content": "They're back baby", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7eeafa4edc1d584b8c968e39ce2cf75f", "author": "4040c46e597a5df3b95d6c499ffa8c18", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 1653, "content": "It's an enjoyable game with an okay story, but dude this PC port sucks.\n\nAlso you guys need to stop port begging it's really annoying and it gives me second hand embarrassment.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 1, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "17f4509be4d05e4ab9392ffeab863e9f", "author": "677aadd584e55a8ca177fc68062ed8bb", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 2400, "content": "juegazo como siempre de persona", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ae7d4afe68575b7d93bd6f43ca315179", "author": "b4627848c0495add91137b128d0c899f", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 633, "content": "\u597d\u73a9\u597d\u73a9\n\u9084\u597d\u7576\u521d\u6c92\u8cb7PS4\u7684\u6e23\u756b\u8cea\u548c30\u5e40\n\u7562\u7adfP5\u56de\u5408\u523630\u5e40\u5c31\u7b97\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u52d5\u4f5c\u904a\u6232\u4e00\u5b9a60\u57fa\u672c\n\u7b49\u5f85\u4e0aSTEAM\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u7684\uff01\n\n\u5e0c\u671b\u4ee5\u5f8c\u7cfb\u5217\u4f5cPC\u7248\u80fd\u90fd\u540c\u6642\u767c\u552e\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "419e51690a2e58b0b5ab865980eaeda9", "author": "48b8c787fe2f5090b898d9bef412c314", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 784, "content": "P5R please !!!!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2ca6af29e53552e2b734656c915e67dc", "author": "2421e066c7df5d8c867d9b81751795e8", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 530, "content": "use a controller", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fa6ceb2f5d6a5ec084271087bdd69efe", "author": "ac5c549c6d3e589bab5c14233d6b1cb6", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 3553, "content": "The perfect continuation of Persona 5 in my personal opinion! 10/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9c50a6ec5bae5c1a86a0fb648c472db7", "author": "24481e9c6fa15666958e743a0c7d07a7", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 4049, "content": "Spent half the game rubbing some dudes feet", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e2beef97e60c577f9afb9d2edc57288b", "author": "35cb2900b6eb5a36a0074638e8d6a060", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 4736, "content": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5439\u7206\u5c31\u5b8c\u4e8b\u4e86 \n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bf9bf97c8aeb5615b8a7d5244daacfe7", "author": "90a117a08023516cbf3d80d34c706c6b", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 7262, "content": "Best single player game I ever played!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5ac42a03f0155d2eb56a38807e7e719b", "author": "e58c7588854b5c37b6339cf562161d7a", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 9573, "content": "Il gioco \u00e8 fantastico, peccato per i vari bug.

However, having since played the PS4 version of the game I can confidently say it is an incredible game. A true sequel to the base version of Persona 5, P5S is an absolute perfect blend of both Dynasty Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, in a way that I have not seen from any other \"warriors\" type cross over game to date. \n\nThough the combat system has changed entirely to a hack and slash action RPG style game, it still manages to maintain a lot of the systems that made Persona 5 what it is, such as the baton pass, Persona fusion, elemental weaknesses, one mores and even adding Showtime attacks which mimic their Persona 5 Royal counterparts. On top of this, you still have the typical Persona gameplay of wandering about various parts of Japan and spending time with your buds, as you would expect, but this time without the time constraints. \n\nAnother aspect that thoroughly impressed me was the story, though it is \"just a crossover game\" it is not treated as such and given the full seriousness and treatment of a sequel to Persona 5. With a fully fleshed out story, two fantastic party members with their own story arc and all the character development from P5 that makes Morgana a bearable addition to the cast now! \n\nYou get the full on Persona experience and the full on Dynasty Warriors experience with this game, the best of both worlds with no shortage on either of them. So if you're a fan of either game, I highly recommend this game. The only thing I will say is go play Persona 5 Royal first, as you will lose a lot if you haven't played that game first.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "60568a287b9352a09251065004037a26", "author": "4dccda51a564538ab138317b0d841da2", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 1746, "content": "Ryuji's the best tbh", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "06e38aeaf6f859198c4ce885740d56b3", "author": "b82d79305d595983b37b4f7c28b44813", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 3178, "content": "p5 yyds", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "943fe8f3e2795568a2ef72245a2632af", "author": "14db5de83a1050d0920cf3d9fb6b83cc", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 2827, "content": "\u597d\u73a9", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a573bd38e7fc583592d9f19687c47a07", "author": "c581c3b550485e5587cbf35a77ce55c1", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 6734, "content": "\u597d\u73a9\u5c31\u5b8c\u4e8b\u4e86\uff0c\u76ee\u524d80\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fd8\u662f\u6ca1\u73a9\u591f\uff0c\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dc64f074f8e05689895eac7c97a3d1e3", "author": "d44b9772abd35e989c92f038c1a32c2b", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 4189, "content": "\u6f6e\u5230\u51fa\u6c34", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5e255f2ef5d051d9a759a992bb4cdf68", "author": "eaaf24d3c7f5583c8079f03d1b2b158e", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 4836, "content": "this game made me moist", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a56627217c6c5b5d8a92f687e6c8851f", "author": "3f8a9dc73d52583086ae8bf534123991", "date": "2021-03-06", "hours": 3643, "content": "Game itself is great. 95/100 easily.

Being able to just go nuts and fight through hordes of enemies is satisfying in a way. The Dire Shadows are a nice challenge to overcome, unless you're like me who forgot they existed until the final boss and cheesed most of them. The requests section is also a nice feature, just going after small goals for small or helpful rewards that you can just choose to completely ignore if you're on a time crunch or just hate having fun. I like being able to re-fight bosses but I am still upset that you can't re-fight Cognitive-Joker. Like every warriors game though, your AI party members suck ass, but that's to be completely expected. They do what they need to do so you can go ham on the enemies and not have to constantly worry about yourself. Until you get into late-game or are underlevelled/powered, then that's just on you.

The combat system introduced is great. I really hope Atlus continues on this path for the Persona series. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy turn based as much as any fan of that combat system, but having free range of movement while also being able to still obtain new persona's, summon current persona's, has been a great way to enjoy combat scenarios. \n\nLike any JRPG there is some repetitiveness, but I don't mind that, and I honestly don't think any fan of JRPG's should, as this is something we've done for however many years we've (fans of JRPG's) been fans of this genre. I'm enjoying the story, and I've basically put every game on the shelf until I complete this. \n\nI won't go into depth detail, because frankly, I'm not great at that. What I can do is give you my recommendation for this game tho. I am not disappointed with my purchase, and I can't wait to see how it ends.

As batalhas em turnos s\u00e3o substitu\u00eddas por um misto de combate t\u00e1tico com o j\u00e1 tradicional Musou da s\u00e9rie Dynasty Warriors, remetendo bastante ao combate de Final Fantasy VII Remake (e at\u00e9 superando-o, na minha opini\u00e3o).\nO level design dos Pal\u00e1cios, as dungeons de P5S, \u00e9 um pouco mais aberto, mas acredito que perdeu um pouco da qualidade nesse processo. H\u00e1 poucos puzzles, alguns Pal\u00e1cios s\u00e3o demasiadamente curtos, e tamb\u00e9m senti que o formato repetitivo acabou tornando a experi\u00eancia um pouco cansativa.\n\nOs outros aspectos tradicionais da franquia Persona ainda est\u00e3o l\u00e1, tais como a captura e fus\u00e3o de personas e o social sim, por\u00e9m, de forma bastante adaptada para um jogo mais linear que seu antecessor. Ou seja, nada de planejamento, datas, encontros e estudos, o jogo segue um \u00fanico roteiro do in\u00edcio at\u00e9 seu fim, mas tamb\u00e9m deixando uma boa margem para explora\u00e7\u00e3o e numerosas sidequests. \nApesar de todo conte\u00fado, a hist\u00f3ria principal \u00e9 consideravelmente mais curta que Persona 5/Royal, tendo aproximadamente 40h de dura\u00e7\u00e3o. Longo, voc\u00ea diria? Para o padr\u00e3o normal, sim, mas \u00e9 v\u00e1lido ressaltar que Royal possui quase 130h apenas com o conte\u00fado principal. No entanto, acredito que a dura\u00e7\u00e3o deste game \u00e9 a ideal, principalmente pela forma na qual a narrativa \u00e9 apresentada.\n\nFalando em narrativa, sinto que P5 Strikers replica muitos dos arcos j\u00e1 apresentados em P5, mas em outros contextos; a hist\u00f3ria como um todo acaba parecendo um \"repeteco\" do original, e apenas brilha nos momentos mais aut\u00eanticos, como no caso dos arcos que envolvem os dois novos personagens, Zenkichi e Sophia. No mais, trata-se de uma hist\u00f3ria que deixar\u00e1 o jogador estranho ao universo de P5 bastante perdido; recomendo jogar ou assistir um resumo do game anterior antes de partir para este.\n\nOs di\u00e1logos, a dublagem e a trilha sonora continuam impec\u00e1veis como sempre, vale a pena conferir o game apenas por esses tr\u00eas aspectos!\n\nResumindo: \n\nUm game excelente e uma boa sequ\u00eancia para Persona 5/Royal. Recomendo cautela a quem n\u00e3o conhece os jogos anteriores.\nPor\u00e9m, \u00e9 um MUST PLAY.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9911234f84a65db88f4c7fa89cb90167", "author": "86eb395d287d556bab9436f8e7662401", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 2040, "content": "Persona 5 - 2, sensacional!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "db985807d9db570e96514e7da8050338", "author": "8f31f27337a5565880725effcbcc73c4", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 5136, "content": "The real time combat took me a bit to get used to but this is, in every way that matters, a full on sequel to Persona 5.

At least for mobs.\nNo romance... HOW DARE YOU!!!\nCharacter well Ryuji must have joined the navy because he's cursin like a sailor otherwise new characters are fine, and old characters are consistent.\nGame overall? Well i think it's a  fun concept that needs more polish. I would enjoy seeing another game like this more in line with the classic confidant system, some better \"levels/dungeons\", and be a little more polished combat wise.\nShould you buy this game? Yes, if you're fine with royal not being a thing, turn based combat being booted, and no confidant/social/romance system.

The characters talking with each other felt as natural as it did in 5/Royal. Having the gang travel Japan was also a good decision, as it meant not being stuck in Tokyo the entire time (which they could've very easily done if they wanted).\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-From a story standpoint, Royal is never mentioned. At all. Also, all non-party confidants (except three) never appear in the game.\n-Game reminds you of romances, but doesn't actually care what you chose.\n-Game doesn't do a good job of encouraging you to switch up party members, but still forces some party members in some select fights.\n-Game isn't difficult (especially if you find the right item/bond build that allows you to mow over anything in the game).\n-Lack of combo depth.\n-Music is mostly P5 ost remixes with some new stuff (and overall, not as good as the original).\n-Where is Igor?\n-Play with a controller.\n-Story doesn't understand it's own universe's rules.\n\nTo expand upon the last point, there are two times the game contradicts their own rules. First, in the first dungeon, it's shown that, besides the party, people enter the Jails as their shadows. However, the game breaks this rule several times, and doesn't explain why.\nThe second major gaffe: Morgana mentions at the very end of the game that its the \"surprise of receiving a calling card\" that causes Desires to manifest, similar to Treasures. This is just a flat wrong explanation of how the calling cards work from both P5/Royal, as well as from the same game.\n\nAs to the other points, the combat is basic and easy, and there are ways to break it (hint: Two things break shields. weaknesses and criticals) which makes combat a joke. I used Yusuke the entire game and wasn't really punished for it, which shouldn't be ok in a game that emphasized elemental affinities.\n\nIf you can get over these somewhat minor gripes, the game is fun. I would only recommend it if it gets a price cut or sale though.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1e893030274f5c04bfc4a68922b7716b", "author": "42e2a8e1b58f50e1958949cb56389178", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 7515, "content": "After a whole playthrough of the game, I can say that I really enjoyed P5S. There were some flaws, of course, but for the most part, it was nice to see the Phantom Thieves back in action.\n\nHere's some Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n-Remixed music, including new tracks with vocals by Lyn Inaizumi\n-Dual Audio (It's there if you want it. I'll stick with muh English)\n-Familiar stylish UI\n-Personas' properties (weaknesses/strengths/etc) are the same\n-The game is a sequel and makes references to P5 Vanilla (Royal's 3rd Semester was not canon)\n-The \"musou\" combat is delegated to a per-encounter basis. Ambush/Get detected by a wandering shadow, then more shadows pop out in a closed off area. Defeat, then move on.\n-Stealth in a musou game. Who'd a thunk it?\n-This game is Persona first, Musou second.\n\nSome things to note:\n-Game has a tendency to crash on loading screens (possibly due to DRM)\n-Due to it being a sequel, it will contain some spoilers for P5\n-Since P5R was not canon, Kasumi is not playable\n-Story can also seem a bit underwhelming compared to 5, and not as long\n-The DLC Personas of 5 are, of course, missing (they were DLC, of course)\n-No social links [Replaced by Bond System. This gives you access to an array of perks, kind of like talents]\n-Must beat game first to unlock Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal battle themes (\"Last Surprise\"/\"Take Over\"), unlike the methods for Switch/PS4\n-The system for jumping to pillars, chandeliers, etc is a bit awkward and can catch you mid-combo\n-If the English voice track feels blemished or sounds off, the VAs recorded out of studio during the pandemic. It sounded fine to me with headphones on.\n\nThat said, most of the Cons are mild gripes.

Great game, but I've had my own wave of emotions playing it.\n\nIn my opinion, the game plays almost nothing like a normal musuo game. This is *very* Persona feeling, it's just not turned based. Taking advantage of elemental weakness is still EXTREMELY important (like every persona game) and I find myself rarely combo-ing normal enemies and only using it during bosses. Once you have SP items available the combat feels more like Persona 5 completely. Combo-ing becomes near useless.\n\nMy thoughts on the story and dungeon designs, I think the first half of the game is considerably better than the end half. There's some depth that is skipped for the last half of the game that makes me feel like things were rushed, or it felt like they had to piece things together in the middle, like they knew what they wanted but needed something there. Especially the final area, it felt SUPER short if you compared it to the first or second. It surprised me how fast I got to the final boss.\n\nI don't know what people mean, I've only ever crashed once while playing the entire game. If you're crashing that often I honestly think your computer just can't handle the game? The game is well optimized in my opinion.

It isn't bad but it also does nothing good. This is a spin off of the original Persona 5 release and really only performs well at giving more screen time to the cast. You could play this without first playing Persona 5 but it would be pretty pointless. The story isn't that good and neither is the gameplay. You are here for the cast you wouldn't even know. This also does not follow Persona Royal and the new character from that version is not here.\n\nNone of the side characters from Persona 5 are in the game outside of Sojiro at the very start and end of the game. None of your favorites from the social links return at best you might get one line of internal monologue from Joker acknowledging their existence. One other character does show up for maybe 10 lines and that's it. \n\nSocial links themselves do not exist. Bonding points are here which you can use to level up skills that unlock during the main story. It's basically just a bar that goes up from pretty much anything you do without the main reason we did social links in the first place. Romance does not happen here but there are two bonding points in the game. But they are quickly forgotten and never mentioned again. \n\nThe story is average at best. Basically a rework of Persona 5 with more changing of hearts. If you've ever played a JRPG or watched anime you likely can see where it is going. Entirely forgettable and just an excuse to bring the cast back together. This could be more forgiven if the gameplay was great but...\n\nThe Shin Megami Tensei series perfected turn based combat many years ago with the Press Turn system. Persona 5 being an actual spin off of the main series uses a modified system of it. Strikers throws out all of that for an action system combined with musou elements. The main issue is it is incredibly repetitive and gets boring quickly. Each character has a few basic combos, their gun and their persona abilities. They also each learn 4 arts from continuing to use them further making them more useful and unique. But the kicker is you are now using all this up against the musou style of gameplay with tons of waves of enemies. It starts interesting but quickly overstays its welcome. Regular mobs are fairly weak but mini and especially bosses are HP sponges. The weakness abuse/critical hits/technical hits all carries over but it just isn't much fun. After the second jail I lowered the difficulty from hard to easy just so I could see the story.\n\nThere are two new characters joining the cast. Both fit in nicely and enjoyed their dialogue during the story. They are even better in combat though. I would say they might be to good and you might not want to leave them out in favor of your past favorites.\n\nThere is no time management in this game so you can freely leave the dungeon at any point. But it is like no one bothered to play test the game. You can leave from any checkpoint to restore your HP/SP and even warp back to that same point. So why not just make the checkpoint restore these things without wasting our time leaving and coming back? SP itself is scarce at the start of the game. The further you go in the main story the more bond skills you unlock to increase ways of restoring it. But it should just naturally recover from using normal attacks.\n\nThe voice acting (Japanese at least) is great and so is the music. Several music remixes and I look forward to getting the OST. The game is just as stylish as Persona 5 from menus to the actual combat.\n\nThe PC port is not that great. I myself had three crashes in my near 32 hours but I hear some people had it way worse. The graphical options are bugged and you'd need to tweak them outside of the game. Also the game is locked at a max 60 fps but the cutscenes run at 30 fps which is very noticeable.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 22, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "47539154ac48584cb484a8bd499561a3", "author": "48f1346560f25254948e1ec0fd434cf6", "date": "2021-03-05", "hours": 449, "content": "Game is good, first time I've found the musou genre vaguely compelling!

So don't buy those if you want manageable load times. In my case though, loading is still exactly as slow even after removing the DLC and uninstalling from HDD reinstalling the game unto my SSD. \n\nOn a whim, I heard that downgrading the drivers to your video card might help matters, so I decided to log into GeForce Experience; and before I started downgrading I started up the game and this time the game loaded in TEN SECONDS! Excited, I exited the game and started it again, hoping that solved the problem but nope. It was back up to 3 to 4 minutes of black screen before the game loaded again. What the hell?

It might be a spin-off or a side story, but it's a good one. Instead of the usual Persona-style combat, battles are replaced with fast paced, small-scale Dynasty Warrior fights, and the battle music has been remixed to match. For everything else: the characters, the music, the style, the writing; it's all there. \n\nWell, almost. It's still a spin-off. There's no social links for example; during the free time segments, all you really do is walk around, shop for items and maybe talk to some party members for some basic dialogue, but nothing like in the main Persona games. That said, it's still an amazing game in its own right, as long as you don't expect a [i]true[/i] sequel.\n\nOf course, if you've never played or otherwise experienced Persona 5, this game will feel alienating as you're missing huge parts of the story and the characters.

ps4 and i can tell you i immediately bought it for the pc master race :D and i can say that the game is a blast to play in term of music and new spin on the gameplay but there are some problems\n\ncons:\n\n- the writing is very poor and everything is super predictable\n\n- the gameplay although fun lacks at some key moments\n\n- i don't know if that was a problem for everyone but the sp management in this game is terrible there are barely any sp potions and you run out of sp so quick and there is no rest options like in the vanilla persona 5  so you have to get to a checkpoint then exit the dungeon come back and only then you will have a full hp bar and sp bar which is a total bummer for me :/\n\n-the final boss was really meh\n\n- the real world was really lacking and there was barely any options of going around and talking with random people yes i know that its a spin off but still everyone around feels like a dead puppet\n\n- some performance issues such as fps drops and one hard crash at the wonderland dungeon\n\n- the side quests were really forced boring and not that fun so after the third dungeon i just stopped doing them because it just felt like a chore at that point\n\n-the game is a bit short for persona standards took me 30 hours to finish it\n\n- there are moments where the game intentionally prolongs the game play with tedious fetch quest /main objective and it just felt as if they doing it because they ran out of ideas but needed to put more hours in the game\n\npros:\n\n- the music holy h@ll the music i was having so much fun listening to it and was just such a delight and i think one of the best things in the game is the music\n\n- animations look a lot better everything just looks and goes super smooth\n\n- the new characters are super awesome and i really enjoyed the new addition to the cast\n\n- the dungeon design is just super beautiful and finally they have some depth to them\n\nin conclusion yea i know there are more cons than pros but still the game was super enjoyable and it is a spin off game for all the non Playstation exclusive gamer's so of course it wont be as good as a normal persona game but for what it is PERSONA 5 STRIKERS is a cool game to play for over the top dynasty warriors game play but it does lack in the other departments so my final score to PERSONA 5 STRIKERS is a 7.5 out

mandatory to do so. \nThis game as of the time of writing this, has some loading problems and there are some bugs here and there. \nRegardless, just make sure to save often.\nOverall I give this game

I was concerned at first that it was going to be more musou than Persona (as in, mostly focused on the combat rather than the story), but thankfully those concerns were immediately alleviated upon booting up the game. I'm not a huge musou fan, and I don't think I've ever unlocked New Game+ in a game that required you to do a bunch of extra stuff before, but I loved this game so much that I did every single quest and every single thing to unlock New Game+. The story really draws you in, and seeing all of the characters I love so much again made me so incredibly happy. I absolutely cried during the ending credits. \n\nThe only issue I have with this game is the crashing -- I noticed it always happens for me on loading screens, and it can be extremely frustrating. Make sure you save as often as possible. Other than that, I have zero complaints. I love all of the new characters, the story, the music, the locations, the aesthetics, the cutscenes, everything. In fact, I love it so much that I started a new game immediately after completing everything in my first run! If you love Persona 5, this sequel is absolutely worth it.

If you've been to Japan, you'll immediately recognize Kyoto, Osaka, Okinawa and many more locations!\n\nThe battle system can be a bit tricky in the beginning (and very lengthy towards later bosses), but it rewards skills and planning, which is an additional metric to perceive progress in the game.\n\nDuring my playthrough, the game only crashed once. I lost 15 minutes of progress, so make sure you'll save at every opportunity you have just in case.\n\nI only feel sorry that this is a game that can be only fully appreciated by gamers who played Persona 5, it's sad that there is no port available just yet. \n\nDefinitely recommended!", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8f3eeaa2c058509f9a2bc2330adb9c30", "author": "60bc8deb242458d98fd625451ea58809", "date": "2021-03-04", "hours": 2751, "content": "good\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f118b6179b455094b7b58bbb1d77f508", "author": "a8ca1fdb86af54d3bccc0e5614948687", "date": "2021-03-04", "hours": 1509, "content": "Paying every persona game after 3 and playing this now it was a great game though it doesn't hit the usual 100 hour mark like most persona games.

Only get it if you really like Persona 5/Royal. If you do, get the BGM DLC as well because Persona 1 soundtrack is very good.\n\nI complete the game in normal difficulty with all \"late game\" personas unlocked all some of miscellaneous achievements in 37 hours. This might be the minimum if you want to enjoy fighting as health bar is very very long for no reasons. When you have the game figured out, gameplay pretty much just drags out forever. \n\nThe highlight for the game has to be the final boss because that makes the Musou part of this game shines. There's not a lot of enemies and more than often just hitting them will be way more enjoyable than spamming affinity then having 30s of getting off the jail and joining back. It gets very repetitive. But the two last dungeons are when difficulty spikes and you must play the game the right way starting from there. I don't think upping the difficulty would make the game any more enjoyable.\n\nThe story is an advertisement for Japan tourism.

And that's just basically it. \n\nI am NOT a fan of how many skills that stop you from moving. Specifically, it feels like Bufu/Zio, and the certain debuffs that stun you, need to be nerfed in effectiveness.

feeling the essence of a good Persona game was still there even if the gameplay changed due to that.\nThere are some parts that seem strange when you fight against certain enemies and you get the feeling you cannot do anything just keep in mind that the those have weaknesses as well.\nAll in all a really good game and for fans of the series I suggest to give it a try since it is not just blindless button mashing(even though I like those every now and then).\nI also suggest to start with the normal difficulty and not higher right of the bat ;).", "comments": 1, "source": "steam",

I understand that other persona spin off games the spin offs can be quite iffy, but nothing in this game really stands out. I've never played a musou game before, but it was amazing, atleast how atlus handled it and incorporated it into the persona world, I have heard it being compared to FF7 Remake's system. While I prefer the turn based system, i definitely understand why people are now calling for this to be the main fighting system in the games. And while not having the day to day life simulator aspect, there are still social events and ways the game gives control to the player in the regular world. \n\nThis deserves not to be a looked at as a sequel, but as a worthwhile 20+ hour dlc of an already 80+ hours amazing game.

I feel pretty fancy getting to play different persona games on different platforms.\n\nOverall, if you like persona or JRPGs in general.. This is a must buy. However be warned, I do recommend playing P5 or P5R before diving into Strikers. It is an exact sequal to where P5 left off and rarely is a sequal that does benefit from playing the previous title.

This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story.

The enviroment is usable in fights (swinging from poles, dropping stuff on enemies), maybe too much. Some fights can be cheaped out this way, but for a majority its fine. The combat system feels very good, they managed to mix the ability system very well with the button mashing. All Strong attacks in some way connect with the current Persona (some cast their go-to spell, offers debuff after a 2 hit-combo with strong attack and so on) so its interesting to just test random ones to see if you like their abilites more. On that note be said, that not all Personas from PE5 made it into this game.\n\nThe full cast is playable and all of them feel unique enough to not be dull. All of them have their unique strengths though.\n\nThe story feels is okayish for a warriors spin off, there have been worse, but towards the ending [spoiler]it feels like they copied the persona 5 a little bit too much, but thats my personal opinion.[/spoiler] Seeing new places however and having more area to go around felt nice. The battlemusic is a really awesome remix thats even after the 20th battle still nice to hear. If you go deluxe edition you get basically every persona game OST covered in some way.\n\nCONS\nSome bosses felt like HP-Sponges, especially the optional ones. A lot of jumping around to not get 1-shotted by some aoe thing, while spending 15 minutes chipping down hp.

Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored.

After 100+ Hours in this game I can happily say this is another fantastic game by Atlus (and KT this time).\n\n[h1] MINIMAL STORY SPOILERS AHEAD[/h1]\n\n[b] Overview[/b]\nThe Phantom Thieves are back and they are prepared to journey across Japan. Strikers' world building feels great, even whist travelling from Tokyo to Sendai, Sapporo, Okinawa, Kyoto, Fu.kuoka and Osaka in the space of 1 month and exploring jails as they go. Each city looks fantastic and are all very lively, an improvement on Persona 5. Though the combat may look a little intimidating to long time Persona fans it feels more at home with the actual combat the Phantom Thieves would go through. The beginning, middle and end of the game is consistently great and Atlus & KT gave a masterpiece such as Persona 5 a sequel it deserved.\n\n[b] Gameplay[/b]\nThis time around the Phantom Thieves are tasked at exploring Jails across Japan, city-sized palaces ruled by some of the most powerful people in Japan. To fit the combat of Strikers, Jails are much larger than Palaces found in Persona 5 but are still filled with small details the can really grab your eye. A lot of enjoyment can be gained from just running around these Jails and mopping up shadows just for fun. \nAs I mentioned before the combat is rather different than your traditional SMT or Persona game, but the most pivotal mechanics are still used in Strikers. Every Phantom Thief has their original personas and skills but all have a unique playstyle for you to experience and decide on your 'main'. Joker still has his wildcard ability, but due to the lack of Igor in the velvet room he only has access to half the personas available in Persona 5. Their different weapons and guns make for a whole new experience depending on who you use, and their weapon actually changes in their hand if you buy a new one.\n[list]\n[*] [b] Joker[/b] - Access to all elements, fast attacks and an all-around beginners character\n[*] [b] Ryuji[/b] - Electric user, Slower bat attacks but do much more damage, focus on Physical skills and tanking\n[*] [b] Ann[/b] - Fire user, Fast whip attacks and fastest gun (Sub-Machine gun), focus on magic skills\n[*] [b] Morgana[/b] - Wind user, Fast sword attacks with a lot or aerial usage, mainly a healer\n[*] [b] Yusuke[/b] - Ice user, Normal sword attacks but with flurry combos, crit monster, focus on Physical attacks\n[*] [b] Makoto[/b] - Nuclear user, Normal fist attacks, all around nuclear powerhouse, an all-around character\n[*] [b] Futaba[/b] - Navigator, non-playable but can provide buffs, healing and protection for the team.\n[*] [b] Haru[/b] - Psy user, Very slow axe attacks but with very high damage, focus on gun attacks and combo skills\n[*] [b] Sophia[/b] - Bless user, Fast Yo-yo attacks with a Rhythm mechanic, high-skill based character but can be used as a healer[/list]\n\n[b] Overworld[/b]\nThe lack of 'daily life' of this game may put off a few from picking this game up, but the amount of interaction in the overworld decently makes up for it's absence. Every city has many NPCs to interact with and all shopkeepers have their own dialogue (and there are a lot of shops). After progression in the story the Phantom Thieves may be standing around town with dialogue of their own [strike] unfortunately it is not voiced[/strike]. They may also hand you requests which furthers the level of interaction you get from your long time allies. Every city looks vastly different from the next with their very own top tier theme, which really helps set each city apart from another. \n\n[b] Music[/b]\nC'mon, it's a Persona game, you should know by now that is has fantastic music, and this game is certainly no exception. From the opening theme all the way till the credits song, in my opinion there is no bad or even mediocre track in the entire soundtrack. Every song fits the theme it requires and makes you want to explore each area in depth just to listen to the smooth Jazz. Speaking of which, p5's Jazz theme has not disappeared, though there is a bit of a metal theme for the more intense battles, which fits the high paced combat perfectly. It's another fantastic job by Shoji Meguro, Lyn, and the whole Atlus sound team.\n\n[b] Graphics and Performance[/b]\nStrikers is a pretty good looking game, the art style of Persona 5 compliments the gameplay of Strikers, using the bold lines and bright colours doesn't get you lost in the fast-paced gameplay. The menu's are the best Persona has ever done, with smooth transitions and every character having a cameo in different sections of the menu. Unfortunately this game was also developed for the switch, which limited how far they could take the graphical aspect of the game. Also this PC port is not the greatest, the cause is unknown but on some systems certain cutscenes will crash the game if viewed in fullscreen. It isn't very well optimised either, enemies will lag out the game using Agidyne, and text looks grainy due to Anti-Aliasing. Overall this doesn't effect the experience too much but it is something to keep in mind if you are debating between buying Strikers on PC or PS4\n\n[b] Story[/b]\nThis is where Persona 5 Strikers really surprised me, as a spinoff I expected a toned down story filled with fanservice to keep the players happy but no. Strikers has a very 'persona-like' story, without the social links. Without a need to build characters (except the few new introductions) Atlus was able to fully focus on the story and make it great from the beginning until the end. The story starts a little weak but really picks up and is definitely on the level of a mainline Persona game story. Each new character fits perfectly into the story and each have their own role to play.\n\n[b] Characters[/b]\nSince this is a sequel to Persona 5 and not Royal, this game does lack Kasumi and any mention of Maruki, but the rest of the Phantom Thieves make their appearance with a new ally - Sophia, a sketchy detective -Zenkichi Hasegawa and an upbeat woman of tech - Kuon Ichinose.\nSophia is 'Humanity's Companion,' an AI Joker discovers in the depths of a Jail. Her main derivative is to learn, as she lost her memory after being dumped into this jail. She accompanies the Phantom Thieves in their trip, inside Joker's phone.  She's bright and bubbly and quite similar to Aigis from Persona 3.\nZenkichi is an employee of Public Security and has been tasked in researching the 'change of heart' epidemic that has swept across Japan. He may be a friend or foe but one thing is for sure, he'll be on your tail this whole trip.\nIchinose is a quirky tech guru that just loves her coding. She just happens to come across the Phantom Thieves and is a HUGE fan. She happily starts working with them to find the true culprit changing these hearts.\n\n[b] Final Thoughts[/b]\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great game to pick up if you're a fan of Persona or hack n slash musou games in general. There is over 100 hours worth of gameplay (including postgame) and it never gets stale. Merciless provides a great challenge in New Game+ and lets you listen to the amazing soundtrack even more.\n\n[h1] FINAL SCORE: 9.1/10[/h1]", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "14c9e626af9c51a7a9b6ec1a453ab519", "author": "c098fd309700544ab89f0a36527653aa", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 348, "content": "it a good game but the fact that it die some time (not freeze and and then die) for no reason dose not help a bit but it is fun", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2f4f9e2b0bcc59dda808f65f87ca49b4", "author": "eea7675972215bfca8308ac9ee512d30", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 4547, "content": "Love the game hope they bring persona 5 or persona 5 royal to steam", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c3401669ca305fdf9153bf475c980c2c", "author": "87f8f1f2bdf358a5b8359a76cc87766f", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 4509, "content": "Good game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1a5e2cbf4e4c56568e0420e1bdad922f", "author": "aef9249293f35890b7cac235cd10da51", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 4894, "content": "This game blew away my expectations for what a \"Musou Persona Game\" would be like.

The Dynasty Warriors combat mechanics work surprisingly well with the Persona conventions you're used to, so adjusting to this gameplay style is easier than you think. Each character is interesting and fun to play with in their own way, and you're properly incentivized to use all of them in different compositions throughout the game.\n\nAside from the combat, the rest of the game is familiar territory: Good story, great voice acting and character dynamics, excellent new music (and fantastic mixes on existing tracks), and a few cool surprises. Despite its nature as a genre and studio crossover, this is a genuine Persona game.\n\nIf you're [i] not [/i] a Persona fan already, this one might be a difficult game to sell you on. It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game. If you're already familiar with the Persona conventions, there should be an option to prevent or skip those kind of pop-ups and show only the ones relevant to new mechanics like the combat.

The Phantom Thieves, The Mind Blowing Eargasm Soundtrack, the Cinematic Show time and All out Attacks, the Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal design has been also given to Persona 5 Strikers from the layout to the games menu to the animations and cut scenes to the city of Japan to the dungeon which were formally known as Palaces in the meta verse now known as Jails. The Fantastic Story exploring the Meta verse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow while life in the real world goes on as the Protagonist and the rest of the Phantom Thieves are on Summer vacation when things start to go downhill. Persona 5 Strikers is as good as a Season 2 of Persona 5 Apart from missing a few signature system such as Social Links from past Persona games.\n\nStory and Game Structure: \nPersona 5 Strikers takes place and continues the story from Persona 5, just pretend Persona 5 Royal didnt happen and i have to pretend i did not romance Yoshizawa Kasumi the new girl from Persona 5 Royal which was not in Persona 5. Persona 5 Strikers continues to explore the world of the Metaverse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow. The Phantom thieves are back in action to return the desires that have been stolen to their owners while also problem solving the change of hearts not by done by them to the Citizens of Japan, while the threat of the Japanese Bureau persecuting the group looms around. Given how Persona 5 Strikers has been made to be a 2nd Season of Persona 5, it is impressive that it retains the feel and Atmosphere that Persona 5 has. \n\nThe most noteable change to Persona 5 Strikers is probably the confidance system and the velvet room, the velvet room changes make Persona 5 Strikers persona fusion much simpler but the loss of confidance system and side stories that accompany them is what diverges from what a propa Persona 5 Season 2 might be. Instead you gain bond points from fighting along side with the Phantom Thieves or real time events or cooking. While these bond points allowed me to unlock new passive skills and upgrade them, i miss hanging out with the indivisual members of the Phantom Thieves hanging out with them during free time and seeing their side  PeRsOnA-L stories. Not that i mind spending less than 10 000 hours on a Persona game but i can spend any amount of time hanging out with the Phantom thieves even if it means to stop playing other games\n\nCharacters, Soundtrack and Atmosphere:\nThroughout Persona 5 Strikers the Phantom Thieves travel to different locations not just in Japan around Tokyo but to Hokkaido and Okinawa during their summer trip plus investigations but also in the meta verse where combat takes place at. The Dugenons formally known as Palaces in Persona 5 and Royal are now known as Jails and they are large and can take hours to complete. Since the jails that you are fighting in transforms the city around you, travelling back and fourth from the Jails and the real world to stock up on items and replenish HP and SP without taking up time in the real world  from previous Persona games has been implemented in Strikers which makes. Exploring different parts of Tokyo and Japan is a lot of fun just like Persona 5 or Royal even if its for the simplest things such as stocking up on items. Both the Duengons and the Map of Persona 5 Strikers are well desgin and made to be memorable. \n\nThe fan favourite Phantom Thieves are back along side new addition Sophia (Rip Kasumi Yoshizawa from Persona 5 Royal) and i don't think there is any game that i have played that has any more memorable characters than those from the Persona 5 series, while also having different personalities they each have something that will make you fall in love with them. The voice acting and animations are also are very well done. Persona 5 Strikers sound track just like any other Persona game i have played is also mind blowing, memorable and just way too good that it gives me and Ear gasm whenever i am listening to it.\n\nCombat:\nPersona 5 Strikers introduce a totally different style in combat by making players stratagize the use of their Persona skills and other mechanics that were from Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal such as the gun mechanics and the cinematic all out attacks and Show Time attacks. Fighting in Persona 5 Strikers feels good as it feels like im playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal using my Persona skills but also combo-ing skills with the Phantom Thieves that i choose to play as not to mention the different personallties of each character and variety of skills and combos they have. Making use of the enemys weakness in Persona 5 Strikers and using Persona skills is also a important aspect of Persona 5 Strikers as you will want to do enough damage to their weak point to use a All out or Show time attack especially against Bosses and higher level enemys since they usually have a large health pool and can soak up a lot of damage. Every Phantom Thieve in Persona 5 Strikers is playable and they each have different fighting styles and combos you can have up to 4 members of the Phantom Thieves in your party however Joker must be in the squad no matter who you choose to have along side with him. The strategy base mechanics such as using Persona Skills switching members of your party or switching the Phantom Thieve that your are currently playing as becomes even more important or harder difficulties.\n\nPros:\n-The Story of Persona 5 Season 2\n-Retains the Feel of Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal\n-Real time combat with turn base mechanics such as Persona Skils etc while also carrying over Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal mechanincs such as Show-time attacks, Gun uasge and All out attacks etc\n-Mind Blowing Ear-gasm Soundtrack\n-Map and Duengon aka Jails Design\n-Voice Acting and Characters\n\nCons:\n-Occasional Crashes on patch 1.0\n-Unanswered answers for players yet to Play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal\n-No Confidance system\n-Slice of Life system from calander has been cut down\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers story is what a Persona 5 Season 2 might be making this summer vacation and road trip around Japan fun, memorable and loving for fans of Persona 5 and Royal but confusing for anyone new to it.  Persona 5 is one of my favourite JRPGS, it has a mind blowing soundtrack, its world is immersive and relatable filled with loveable and memorable characters and supporting characters alongside a really rich story. The only let down being the Confidance System and the Slice of Life Calander system from previous titles which was missing.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 7, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bee86ef6b2b45c46b811000c8e74a796", "author": "eb0ed9691bb1522e8950e840aa320a5b", "date": "2021-03-02", "hours": 3963, "content": "The original Persona 5 is my favorite JRPG of all time, so when I heard that it was getting a Warriors-style spin-off, I was interested but not super excited. I had played Hyrule Warriors and enjoyed it quite a bit but I thought it was lacking in the story department. As more information came out about Persona 5 Strikers (or Scramble: The Phantom Strikers as the fan base knew it before it was localized) it was revealed that it was actually a full-blown sequel to the original game in the style of an action RPG. Now, this was something I could get excited about!\n\nNow that I have finished it, I can say it is a worthy successor to one of my favorite games of all time. Sure, a lot of the social aspects are gone, but that isn't really what Strikers is about. Strikers is a hack and slash road trip for the beloved Phantom Thieves, so if you love P5's cast you'll feel right at home here. HOWEVER, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT PLAYING PERSONA 5. The game assumes you're familiar with the world of that game, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by spoiling the plot of the original game. Seriously, either find a PS4 to play it or hold out a bit longer for a PC port.\n\nAs for the game itself, I found it plays more like Kingdom Hearts than Dynasty Warriors. The combat is fluid and brain-numbingly fun. Each character has unique quirks that make them exciting and fun to play as. Being able to switch between them at a moment's notice makes the combat constantly feel fresh. My only real complaint about the game is that some of the dungeons feel a little hollow, and I think the story leans too heavily into the themes of the first game. Atlus had the opportunity to do something really interesting here, and they do with the addition of some new characters. But a lot of the plot, especially near the end, feels like a retread.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of Persona 5 this is a must-buy. If not, go play the original game and come back to this.

This game is an amazing sequel. Not only does it evolve P5's gameplay, but it evolves the Warrior style gameplay as well. I love getting to see the full cast together in more scenarios that's something that P5 felt lacking in, but here we get to have a wonderful adventure with them and 2 new interesting characters that don't hog the spotlight. It's a great game, well worth the time we had to spend waiting for it.

Even though it transitioned from a turn-based RPG to an action-based musou game, it still feels very much like Persona, with every gameplay staple intact. Weaknesses, technicals, elements, baton pass, and more; all wrapped up in a sexy and stylish art style and UI that's basically Persona 5's trademark. I often get bored of musou games very quickly because of it's extremely repetitive nature and simplistic combat, but Strikers does not have this problem at all since, like I mentioned, it has all of the gameplay staples you'd expect from a Persona game, which wildly varies the gameplay and always keeps you on your toes; especially if you play on higher difficulties. The SP system is also back where you can't recharge SP unless you return to the real world, or use items which are either expensive or hard to come by. This encourage you to constantly swap party members so you keep your gameplay variety fresh and entertaining (along with characters getting new passives or skills the more you play as them).\n\nThe only negatives I can really say about Strikers is that there is significantly less real-life activities to do. They are still there, and you can explore and talk to people, but the volume of stuff you can do is significantly lessened from P5. This is because you no longer have a time limit to complete your objective in the metaverse. If you never played Persona 5, this won't really mean anything to you, but to those who have played it, you probably should know that.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "60c32d7d9e3252c8a137c88ea7e01360", "author": "01dbc8bbcb0250c0b1a3adff461414b6", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 4617, "content": "Feels like an an actual Persona game more than a Dynasty Warriors game!!\n\nPlaying persona 5 but with live fight is pretty much what this game offers.\n\nCompared to some Hylian game that came out a little while ago, which felt like a mashing convention, this game is original and follow the Persona genre gameplay.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "390773477ea456608a95b47cc17bc0f3", "author": "c618f26c1b1d579a9fdb6e24670ab33d", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 4004, "content": "It's just fun.

Playing Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal is not necessary to follow the story, but it does enrich the experience. The characters are fun as always - including the new ones - and the combat actually has a fair amount of depth to it. It uses a lot of the Persona from P5 in a sort of action-rpg type of way, slowing down time to allow the player to pick the correct ability. Also, each playable character has their own unique mechanics, so while you can switch freely between each character and know basically how to play them, there is definitely room to improve with them. All the characters are viable, so I found myself switching them to fit the situation.\n\nThe music is... [i]chef's kiss[/i]. \n\nThe only gripe I have about the game is the lack of social links, or rather the opportunities they offered to spend time with the characters. The Bond system is sort of the replacement here, with completing certain social activities gives points that are dropped into stat-enhancing modifiers, and the ability to unlock new modifiers by doing requests for different characters.\n\nI hope the release of this game and Persona 4 Golden on Steam are signs that Atlus will be bringing Persona 5 Royal to PC, but in the meantime this will do just fine. P5S stands on its own with a well-written story, gratifying gameplay and a reunion (or introduction) with this series' lovable thieves.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "53723cf0c616594fb42ba10e08947771", "author": "ee41125df01b5cfcbac4c99c277a9fa4", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 3170, "content": "Haven't finished the game as of this review, but from what I've experienced so far this game has been a lot better than I thought it would be! I've played Personas 3-5, so hearing that Persona 5 Strikers was gonna be a Dynasty Warriors type game, a genre that I've never tried before, I was skeptical but still wanted to experience the story and see the Phantom Thieves again. Everything this game has shown off to me has put a big dumb smile on my face. The great combat system and bond point system, the returning music tracks along with new ones are always amazing, and the new characters that this game introduces are all great. If you're like me and have played Persona 5 but are on the ropes about trying this game, I highly recommend. Do be aware though, this game takes place after the events of the original Persona 5, not Royal. So don't expect there to be any references or any characters exclusive to Persona 5 Royal. I do also highly advise playing the original or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game in order to understand the Phantom Thieves more and so you're not completely confused on the story.

It feels like the same story of Persona 5 Royal, only with a different coat of paint. Some of the plot twists in the story (at least imo) can be seen coming a mile away if you pay attention. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal, I guarantee you'll love this game's story, but if you have, just be warned that it might feel repetitive.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in my opinion is hardest in the midgame, when enemies are becoming difficult and you have to strategize to capitalize on their weaknesses as well as dodge their strong attacks. Lategame just becomes a cycle of spamming effective skills to stunlock, AOA, repeat until dead, top off SP as needed with items. I did play on the normal difficulty however, so YMMV.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nA great game in the Persona series, though not without its problems and caveats, but if you're willing to overlook them, I guarantee you that you will enjoy this game, provided you enjoy Warriors-style gameplay loops.\n\nAlso, Sophie is best girl.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "55e843e59a4456e882e4d2b36b70579d", "author": "0ce411ba54d25a29b013c6b28f13d4f6", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 3167, "content": "pog", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "de7318c70420586da36232c771e269f4", "author": "92fa8b92e6385eaa9a75c0c6e8607c9b", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 5395, "content": "Game is very fun and fantastic!

I guess it doesn't matter, they got my money anyway. Won't happen again. As far as the game itself its even more diluted SMT mechanics than typical persona games mixed with a shallow musou action game. The gang goes on a scooby-doo esque tour of japan doing what they do. It was ok, but the crashes are beyond infuriating. If you want to play a good action game play devil may cry 5. If you want to play a good SMT game then just google that shit there's like a dozen of those.

characters!\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised by how substantial the game turned out to be -- My save logged 38 hours, and I kinda rushed through the game because I was so invested in the story, so other people might have longer times if they went out of their way to do all the optional content as well.\n\nLoved all the interactions between the original cast, the new additions of Zenkichi and Sophia were absolutely fantastic and played off the main group wonderfully, the soundtrack is phenomenal (as was to be expected, really), the story was fun and in true Persona fashion, the combat was fun and all in all I basically found myself unable to put the game down until I beat it, lol. Speaking of the combat, I really love the showtime and all-out attack mechanics! They're super extra and I love it whenever I get the chance to use one.\n\nThe plot of the game may have been a little predictable in some areas *because* it was in true Persona fashion, but it really did not feel detrimental to the game at all and it was still a very enjoyable experience regardless (and it also felt very nice to have a theory forming in your head to turn out to be true too)!\n\nAll in all, P5S really felt like a good and proper sequel game to me despite it not being in the classic Persona game format.

The story is as funny and emotional as ever and there are improvements on almost every level; The music is great, the characters still keep their development from the last game, the UI somehow tops the original, and the combat is very fun and addicting. I would suggest this game for everybody but the characters often refrence moments and characters from the original game and don't explain complex things over again like the metaverse or Morgana.\n\nThis section is to grade how worth it the digital deluxe edition is:\nThe digital deluxe edition is hard to say the quality off. In order to access the content you need to push the Play button specifically in Steam for the game and it will ask whether you want to play the game or the 'app'. The quality of the app is very sketchy as right from the start it has a Unity watermark at the beginning. It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5bf32980548d599fb2d6b567b6531af4", "author": "3863a6964ed555128b48e94e1c1509b9", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 2674, "content": "Excellent follow up to the original Persona 5.

You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out.

There are unique and hilarious interactions between these characters that don't revolve around the protagonist. Did you think P5 lacked inter-party dynamics, this game has you covered. Their interactions are funny, wholesome, and personal.\n\nAction: This musou game doesn't feel very musou. The existence of Personas shatters a lot of the repetition that you might normally find in one of those games. Weaknesses matter, status ailments matter, and if you try and button mash you will get mashed. Dial this game up to hard and expect to be legitamely challenged. After the first boss my wrists were sore in a very satisfying way. \n\nMusic: Persona 5's tracks remixed/tuned up to meet the high speed combat. More instruments, more beats, more hype. Each time a new track came up I had to take a moment to pause and just listen. I'll be buying the soundtrack for sure.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f79eef134c9c504184994e11f0cc50a0", "author": "524db83fb095566da10d22312eccc5ca", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 3483, "content": "If you're eye-ing this game then that means a few things: you either played Persona 5/Royal and want more of that, or if you're strictly PC, you're coming from Persona 4 Golden and are curious about this game. Overall Persona 5 Strikers is a unique take on the Persona franchise, and a summary of my thoughts on it could be summed up to *almost* more of the same if you're coming from Persona 5, or a somewhat familiar but also not-so familiar experience if you're coming from Persona 4 Golden, even though this installment in the series has wildly different gameplay from both Persona 5 *and* Persona 4 Golden. Details below.\n\nBefore I talk about anything else though, discussing the story must come first, as Persona 5 Strikers is set *after* the events of the main game of Persona 5 (NOT Royal, as I believe Strikers was released in Japan before Royal debuted anywhere). Following that, naturally the experience is enhanced if you have played Persona 5 from start to finish, and a few things about the mainline title are naturally spoiled. THAT SAID, Strikers actually does a very good job of being vague to the events of Persona 5 with the least amount of spoilers possible, so you can absolutely get away with playing this without playing Persona 5 first. Just be warned that a few things *are* spoiled, so it's definitely not spoiler free.\n\nMoving right along, the plot is written very well I thought; I went into this not actually expecting much, but I came out of it pleasantly surprised. Strikers' storytelling is identical to that of Persona 5 (surprising absolutely nobody), except this time all of your party members are right there from the get go. ATLUS introduces the new characters very nicely; I was fully expecting the new characters to feel a little awkward and forced, but they quickly found their place within the rest of the cast, and by the end they felt like they belonged and have been there all along. At some points, I felt as if Strikers had even stronger story points than Persona 5.\n\nThe gameplay I thought was unique; this game is a full on hack-n-slash beat-em-up type of game, which is very different from the main titles in this franchise. A word of warning that it never really changes its combat up too much throughout the entire game, so it becomes repetitive after a while. I frequently had to take breaks because of how repetitive it can get, and I found myself thinking that taking on additional requests that you get throughout the game to be kind of a chore since there's no real variety in the requests that you get. However, what *is* there is fun; the hack and slash combined with the tried and true persona summons works very well. There are a variety of combos to remember, and each character has their own set, along with their own elemental strengths and weaknesses previously seen in Persona 5. If you've played Persona 5, the old cast will feel pretty familiar as a result. It's worth trying every character out as soon as you're able to as well, since every character plays differently as far as their combos go. Pro tip: make sure you get comfortable with a myriad of party members too. It will not only expand your tool set when confronting powerful shadows, but there's a specific part where you'll have to basically use all of them at some point.\n\nPerformance wise, this game runs very well on my GTX 1080; I didn't see a single frame drop, except for one spot in one of the dungeons which turned out to be a complete one off situation. This game is optimized well, but the only problem is that this game has a tendency to crash when loading into and out of the Metaverse. Please remember to save often, as crashing at some points could mean having to redo tough fights. I myself crashed twice at one specific section and had to play the same section three times total before I finally got through it. Those two crashes were the only crashes I had within my 45 hours of game time, however.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a great hack-n-slash game, and is a very good extension to Persona 5. While the gameplay can get repetitive, overall I had a lot of fun with this title and it really quenched the thirst of wanting more Persona 5 that I didn't even know I had.

De plus il n'y a pas de sauvegarde auto donc je vous conseille fortement de sauvegarder aussi souvent que possible pour vous \u00e9viter de refaire un donjon entier et tuer 4 fois le m\u00eame boss comme j'ai d\u00fb le faire. . \u00c0 ce jour il n'y a toujours pas de correctif. Apr\u00e8s ce genre de probl\u00e8me est variable d'une personne \u00e0 une autre, en ce qui me concerne le jeu a crasher 2 fois, j'ai arr\u00eat\u00e9 de jouer, j'ai repris le lendemain et le jeu n'a plus jamais crasher.  Vous voil\u00e0 avertis maintenant passons \u00e0 mon \u00e9valuation globale.\n\nOmega force est un studio bien connu pour ses jeux \"musou\" o\u00f9 vous \u00eates lach\u00e9 sur une carte et devez affronter des hordes d'ennemis afin de lib\u00e9rer des zones ce qui vous d\u00e9bloque ensuite l'acc\u00e8s au boss de la map. Bien que r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs, Il y a de tr\u00e8s bon jeux de ce genre je pense notamment \u00e0 berserk and the band of the hawk. Ce point \u00e9tablis, sachez que ce n'est absolument pas la formule appliqu\u00e9 ici et c'est tant mieux. \n\nVous avez aim\u00e9 persona 5? Et bien r\u00e9jouissez vous car Persona 5 S  reprend \u00e0 peu pret apr\u00e8s tout ce qu'il y avait de bien dans l'\u00e9pisode original. Les palais sont remplac\u00e9 par les prisons mais fonctionnent plus ou moins de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. Vous parcourez la zone, vous devez r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer 3 objets qui vous ouvre le chemin jusqu'au boss avant de revenir dans le monde r\u00e9el pour enfin d\u00e9v\u00e9rouiller l'acc\u00e9s \u00e0 la chambre du boss et lui envoyer votre carte de visite. Tout pareil je vous dis. Les combats sont de type action-rpg mais reprennent toutes les m\u00e9chaniques de persona 5. Les one more, les all out attack, les finish, les baton pass, tout y est. Les combats ne sont pas trop long et tout s'enchaine instinctivement d'une simple touche. Vous pouvez par ailleurs utiliser des \u00e9l\u00e9ment du d\u00e9cord pour vous aider et utiliser une pause active vous permettant de prendre le temps de choisir votre persona et de viser les ennemis. Enfin vous pouvez switcher de personnage \u00e0 tout moment. Et je vous avertis tout de suite, si vous jouez avec Makoto, vous allez rouler sur vos ennemis tel un rouleau compresseur d\u00e9livrant la justice divine. Enfin la velvet room est l\u00e0 bien entendu avec son compendium \u00e0 remplir et de nombreux personae \u00e0 fusionner et am\u00e9liorer. \n\nIl y a des petits changement tout de m\u00eame. Tout d'abord pas de limite de temps. Vous pouvez sortir et entrer dans les prisons \u00e0 volont\u00e9. Ensuite pas de social link, mais vous aurez de nombreuses occasions de parcourir les diff\u00e9rentes villes du jeu afin de discuter avec votre \u00e9quipe, ce que je vous recommande car cela vous permettra d'acquerir certain objets uniques et de d\u00e9couvrir des dialogues franchement sympa. De plus, 2 nouveaux utilisateurs de persona font leur entr\u00e9e et l'un d'eux est vraiment cool. Et en parlant des villes, elles ne sont pas immenses et les activit\u00e9s y sont limit\u00e9es aux enqu\u00eates et au shopping, mais ont le m\u00e9rite de faire ressortir cette ambiance japonaise propre aux jeux persona et m\u00eame de vous apprendre quelques petites choses comme les diff\u00e9rences de dialecte ou les sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s culinaire propre \u00e0 chaque r\u00e9gion. Si vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 jou\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie des yakuza vous devriez apercevoir des choses famili\u00e8re ;) . La cuisine m\u00eame si elle n'est pas franchement n\u00e9cessaire apporte un petit plus et j'ai eu beaucoup de plaisir \u00e0 transformer Joker en grand chef. Enfin il y a un syst\u00e8me de \"lien\" qui vous permettra d'acqu\u00e9rir des points, en collaborant avec vos \u00e9quipiers en combat ou en accomplissant des qu\u00eates, \u00e0 utiliser pour obtenir des bonus comme gagner plus d'argent, se soigner apr\u00e8s les combats, ou bien encore augmenter vos stats.\n\nLe jeu est certes beaucoup plus court mais pas moins intense. Les qu\u00eates annexes ne sont pas terribles mais je vous encourage \u00e0 les faire car elles d\u00e9bloquent certains avantages non n\u00e9gligeables pour finir le jeu. Le syt\u00e8me de fusion de persona vous occupera un moment car pour obtenir certain persona il n'y a pas d'autre choix que de faire d'abord gagner des niveaux aux personae n\u00e9c\u00e9ssaires \u00e0 la fusion. Take your time.\nje n'ai que deux choses \u00e0 dire pour finir : Donnez-nous persona 5 sur steam et makoto c'est la meilleure.\n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e7cca675e2d05c1380c521b2883618b3", "author": "66bd066f49ba58efa96d233be5b90e5f", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 3877, "content": "Yes", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "819f2cb2bf505f4e93bac44db00170fa", "author": "a52817e407ea593d811d20e32670f63d", "date": "2021-03-01", "hours": 3506, "content": "It's weird how the sequel came to PC and Switch before the original game/Royal.

You get to interact with the party and the cutscenes you share with the Phantom Thieves are all quite cozy and just plain JRPG comfort food. \n\nSecond, this is NOT turn based combat, it's a sort of spin on Dynasty Warriors, meets active RPG, meets mild turn based mechanics. Sound messy? It is when you first jump in, but after everything is explained to you? You'll be gliding through combat like a beast. Essentially you have buttonmashing combos to take out trash, you can add some spice by changing what buttons you hit for different actions to occur. Whenever you press the \"Summon\" key (the key to actively bring out your Persona, you are given a list of spells and abilities to select from, time is halted during this. Additionally, there is gunplay, all you do is target enemies with a gun and fire at them--time slows down to like 1/8th speed during this mechanic.I will note that despite this being in the \"Dynasty Warriors\" archetype of games, I find it an unfitting description. This is still an RPG, and the boss fights DO require some strategy, if you run in mashing you will not have much success on these fights, on top of this, it feels less tiresome because you see when encounters are going to occur as opposed to your map just being flooded constantly with enemies.\n\nThird, ever wanted to play as any of the other Phantom Thieves? Guess what, that's a thing this time. In fact, it's an encouraged mechanic-the Baton Pass system in this one can help you juggle powers by switching characters when prompted-it can get nasty if done right. On top of the Baton passes, each character has a set of \"Mastery Skills\", and these were just delightful treasures, I remember each time I unlocked a new one for a character (four mastery skills per character)  I couldn't help but laugh and think \"That sounds overpowered\", oh yeah, they all felt that way-if you know how to play and use the characters skills? You'll turn into a monster on the battlefield. \n\nFourth, the freaking music. Dear god. The. Freaking. Music. This game follows the standard Persona series tradition of having music that's just outright amazing-the fact that they give you the soundtrack with this is simply amazing. I cannot endorse this game's music enough. If you've played the series previously, you know what to expect.\n\n\n\nA few other things.\n-Dynamic artstyle that looks just as flashy as always.\n-Lower system requirements, meaning some older rigs out there can run it.\n-Japanese and English voice options (both are wonderful, and all voice actors returned for their roles.)\n-Game is optimized for any controller type, I normally wouldn't think I'd have to mention this, but I just played another title that was not equipped for all controller types. \n\n\n\nI've bought a plethora of games on Steam, and done a small handful of reviews. (I owe another JRPG a review... better get on that one too.) This is one that I strongly encourage you all to purchase and play. It's a solid experience and worth your time.

It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f744e9b3852452709b9f240c1811ca0c", "author": "60c66c757231557ba00c98376cfc87d2", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 4888, "content": "This game stole my heart and almost 70 hours of my life.

Set to Hard mode if you want any sense of challenge.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can say that this feels like a Persona game. Story, Character, Fantastic voice acting, it's all there. I've never been a Dynasty Warriors fan because all they ever do is rehash the same thing over and over again, and it rarely has any substance. They made a terrible Fate game series, an ok Zelda series, but they finally figured something out. (Of course, Atlus was there to watch over development like a nosy teacher looking over a child doing their homework. But this teacher knows how to teach properly.)\n\nThere hasn't been any problems with the game. You know, like real games when they were released when they were ready. No EA \"We'll fix it later\" shit. \n\nHow The Game Plays: This feels like a Persona game. Let me emphasize this. The battles still have a bit of strategy to them. You can't just run blindly in (at least on Hard difficulty) and wack hack away. And for people who don't want to play a game with battle substance, or the possibility of losing, you have Normal mode. If your 6 year old brother wants to play, you got easy mode. It's perfect. They got a difficulty for all types! And you don't have to start the game over if you find out Normal doesn't cut it 2 hours into the game like I did. \n\nPersona fans will enjoy this. Dynasty Warrior fans will enjoy it. People who hate reading, plot, and character development will despise it. But I suppose if you hate reading in the first place, you probably didn't read this far.\n\nEdit: Beat the game. This is THE BEST Dynasty Warriors game. Better than Dynasty Warriors, better then Zelda, etc. I only wish Makoto would call me back....", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "be41f2e6d413567c99688869cf5560b1", "author": "d406bd427e6a506a89e8d88f7936de77", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 2798, "content": "\u73a9\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5973\u795e\u5f02\u95fb\u5f55\u662f\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6539\u6210\u65e0\u53cc\u8fd8\u662f\u90a3\u5473\u9053\u4e48\uff1f\u73a9\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6de6\uff01\uff01\uff01\u5b58\u6863\u70b9\u5728\u54ea\uff1f\u8001\u5b50\u8981\u56de\u5bb6\u56de\u7cbe\u529b\uff0c\u8001\u5b50\u8981\u56de\u5bb6\u4e70\u4e1c\u897f\u505a\u4e1c\u897f\uff01\uff01\uff01\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5973\u795e\u5f02\u95fb\u5f55\u6b63\u7edf\u7eed\u4f5c\u6765\u8bb2\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u77e5\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u80fd\u7559\u4e0d\u4f4f\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cP5S\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u53e3\uff0c\u628a\u66fe\u7ecf\u7684\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6539\u6210\u65e0\u53cc\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u662fP5S\u5728\u65e0\u53cc\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u90a3\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u9762\u5177\u4f9d\u65e7\u88ab\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u90a3\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u6001\u786c\u6838\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u9488\u5bf9\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8981\u4f60\u5728\u6240\u6709\u89d2\u8272\u91cc\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0a\u573a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u91cc\u6289\u62e9\u4e00\u4e0b\u5230\u5e95\u5e94\u8be5\u9009\u62e9\u8c01\u4e0a\u9635\u3002\u65e0\u53cc+PERSONA\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f7f\u5f97P5S\u5728\u65e0\u53cc\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u663e\u5f97\u72ec\u6811\u4e00\u5e1c\u3002\n\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u5267\u60c5+\u65e0\u53cc+\u8fd8\u662f\u90a3\u4e2a\u5473\u9053\u7684\u5973\u795e\u5f02\u95fb\u5f55\n\u8fd9\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e5f\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u5973\u795e\u5f02\u95fb\u5f55\u7cfb\u5217\u7c89\u4e1d\u5fc5\u987b\u8981\u5165\u624b\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u559c\u6b22\u5973\u795e\u5f02\u95fb\u5f55\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u4e00\u5b9a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u672c\u4f5c\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u3002\uff08\u987a\u4fbf\u8bf4\u4e00\u53e5\uff1aJOKER!!!!\u4f60\u597d\u5e05\uff01\uff01(\u2764\u00b4\u8278\uff40\u2764)\u4e2d\uff09", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bbd587eda5d15514a157d92ff03626a2", "author": "4a40f11e2c265d0695e88c5878c775eb", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 20, "content": "\"B-B-Barbecue!?

Instead i feel frustrated as the enemies(especially the strong one) are very not balance until i reach 'not fun' point. Fair point i play the game in hard mode, but in Royal i played 'Merciless' difficulty in first playthrough, but it was still very doable and feel very fun. I know it's a different genre, but by holding 'Persona 5' title it should reach a same experience.\n\nP5 Strikes also feels very boring for me. It's repetitive and defeating enemies isn't satisfying. I think it's a problem in UX delivery, where in any original Persona's battle we potentially see something new like new enemy, new potential persona, new item, yada yada yada. Strikes has a contradiction design, while ambushing enemy is using same approach as Persona 5, but then every battle information is using musou game style, for example every item and new persona shown in the mid battle. How the **** i could see that in the mid of chaos, why not just using Persona 5 style T_T where everything we got is shown in the end of battle. This problem leads to I feel I don't get anything and not rewarded, heck i even often didn't know i have a new persona. Fusing a new persona is also not really that exciting, as i know i will be pummeled again by the enemy. It's unfortunate where Persona 5 main strength is UI/UX with their very awesome style.\n\nAnd lastly no Kasumi is a huge experience gap and it feels strange for me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f122b23f1ba5df7af8cf42e297477e5", "author": "629538864fbf5fae80dd590c7d1b2eb6", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 976, "content": "If you don't like the police this is probably the game for you", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "04f524837a3c59759fd645a55c3e2b34", "author": "50d32e4e4c5e59179b81e419294ed082", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 5574, "content": "Great fusion of Persona and Musou franchise\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8c86b598c91651d4ab80a360ed5ed27d", "author": "8d104dbc1a445ed18ed12993db783adb", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 1190, "content": "gained 100+ pounds immediately after purchasing this..", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "67111689a154505790c6bb9169c34946", "author": "7f8ae4a506dd50778284143087728834", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 6682, "content": "I like the gameplay, music and the overall vibe of the game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7c297acce9705eb8b7df98d69c75e7a3", "author": "6f378558451b518fa27e7e9059a44553", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 1454, "content": "Great sequel", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "499921c8a3c156aea0085bc896302eee", "author": "d20903514acd51558dc8b29a994819d2", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 4086, "content": "4 REAL??1?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8d17110c4f9f5df3bcf749b6b3336d8f", "author": "1db45b6724775fd9bb4bfda831143993", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 3757, "content": "Woahhhh!

It has worked on everything I have put it on lately and that's a sigh of relief. Enjoy the game! I will not delete the original review because it is important to note issues at launch.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI want to start off by saying this game is an amazing game and a full 10/10... WHEN IT WORKS! I have a beast of a PC and the game runs super well when it decides to. However the game crashes over and over again. It will do so completely randomly as well. And to me I save every chance I can get and still end up losing 20 minutes to an hour each time. of the 26 hours clocked only 17 are on my file because I have lost that much time in the game due to random crashes. \n\nMost of the crashes occur during loading screens. However I did experience one crash in the middle of dialogue and another in the menu. Again I love this game but after the 12th crash I have decided enough is enough. I will suffer the bugs and crashes to finish this game but I DO NOT suggest anybody even try this game until they fix their crashing issues. As a huge fan of the Megaten series I am severely disappointed in the lack of QA for this game. I only have thios here on steam but I have read reports of the PS4 version also crashing on PS5 so it seems the console ports have issues as well although I would imagine far less. \n\nI appreciate the challenge and old feel of a Dedicated area to save (you can only save in the real world or checkpoints in the Jails) but because of a lack of a Autosave feature the crashes have become unbearable. \n\nMy luck is terrible as it has crashed at the worst possible times for me including after an hour of gameplay that could not be saved between. An autosave would have saved me the anger from losing that. Even then I feel like I have given enough time to this game for it to not just be a one off issue.\n\nFor the love of god I hope Atlus and Sega will FIX THE CRASHES! Unacceptable!\n\nEdit: I switched from my Samsung Evo 970 Plus to my SATA Samsung QVO 860 SSD and the crashes completely stopped. I switched back and it crashed. If you have a laptop with only an NVME drive stray from this game as it bugs out with them. I still think it's the Denuvo DRM lacking support for the NVMe drivers.

The sim life is indeed less present, but the charms of the characters still shine the same. The combat is fine, but the game doesn't blow me away like the original (and certainly Royal) did, but it is certainly entertaining enough. Indeed, it's worthy of calling it a Persona 5 sequel rather than a spin-off as the story literally picks up where the original ended and it feels like a warm homecoming (literally) from digital friends you've been missing.\n\nIt is great that another studio manages to capture Persona 5's style so well, even though it is a lot less in-depth. For example, I liked the sim-life part of Persona 5 the most and the turn-based combat a bit less. Although I normally prefer action-based combat, I liked the combat better in the original as it feels a bit messy in Strikers. The attacks don't really feel they have a lot of impact and your super attacks (like in the original) deal the most damage. But they cost a lot of SP, but this may become a bit more balanced if you get a little further in the game and have collected more upgrades.\n\nDespite the sequel being 'not as good' as the original, it certainly doesn't make it bad. The charm of Persona 5 is just as strong and the combat is entertaining enough. Despite the fact that the sim-life aspect is less present, it is fortunately still somewhat there.

L\u2019ost est sympa, je dirai qu\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 1 tier des musiques sont des reprises et remixes de P5, les 2 tiers restants font tr\u00e8s bien le taff, et sont agr\u00e9ables \u00e0 \u00e9couter.\n\nAux abonn\u00e9s absents, les socials links. Il y a des activit\u00e9s avec le groupe et chaques personnes, mais c\u2019est rare (et script\u00e9)\u2026 et c\u2019est dommage. Les nouveaux personnages sont aussi clich\u00e9s qu\u2019ils en ont l\u2019air et on devine vite qui veut nous la mettre \u00e0 l\u2019envers (loul) ils sont cool, mais je n\u2019en dirai pas plus.\n\n\nCe P5S est asser chouettos, je n\u2019en attendais rien, finalement il aura presque su me tenir en haleine jusqu'au dernier donjon (je trouve que \u00e7a devient vers la fin interminable). Une ost solide, un voyage avec les voleurs phantoms \u00e0 travers le japon top. Ca m\u2019aura occup\u00e9 une quarantaine d\u2019heures. J\u2019ai cependant lu et entendu des conneries comme quoi on ne serait pas oblig\u00e9s d\u2019avoir fait P5 ou P5R pour jouer \u00e0 ce jeu, bah la r\u00e9ponse est non, si vous ne savez pas ce qu\u2019est un palais, la trame narative de P5 vanilla, ou d\u2019o\u00f9 viennent tous les personnages principaux, vous n\u2019y serez ni attacher, et un peu perdu. Pour conclure, je pense que ce jeu devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un gros dlc pour ceux qui veulent plus de P5 vanilla. Je le recommande \u00e0 ~20\u20ac, pour ceux ayants ador\u00e9s comme moi P5, mais n\u2019en attendez pas trop.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d8e2579da8a458f8adf47723ee01be8c", "author": "c9f062c64a5a5a47ad23cbf672192216", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 411, "content": "6666666666", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "813df6ba1933567ca43a98f5afe1644e", "author": "6dfd0891fbac5a55b675bfa47b309ca7", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 2601, "content": "It's perfect.

Si bien contaba con problemas que han ido solucionado, en rendimiento fue perfecto. Espero con ansias el port de otros juegos de la saga Persona (como el Royal, tengo muchas ansias de rejugarlo) y de la franquicia Megami Tensei en general.\n\n\nACLARACI\u00d3N:\n\nEste juego no es un simple spin-off, en muchos puntos se siente como una secuela realmente. Pero, no es necesario jugar Persona 5 o Persona 5 Royal para entenderlo, no se tocan detalles de la historia del juego base, as\u00ed que si no tuviste la oportunidad de jugarlo o no te gustan el combate de turnos, no te preocupes.\n\n\n\nJUGABILIDAD:\n\nNo es un simple hack and slash con decenas de enemigos como pueden pensar, tiene mucha m\u00e1s profundidad el combate al utilizar las Personas. No es para nada apretar un bot\u00f3n y listo.\nPuede recordar en ciertos aspectos a los juegos de Devil Summoner protagonizados por Raidou Kuzunoha (m\u00e1s que nada la batalla con el jefe final). Adem\u00e1s de que es super divertido y entretenido el combate, no se te har\u00e1 pesado en ning\u00fan momento.\nSi me tengo que quejar de algo es quiz\u00e1s la ausencia de cambio de personajes en combate, es molesto el no poder hacerlo, es limitante.\n\nGR\u00c1FICOS Y APARTADO ART\u00cdSTICO:\n\nEl juego se ve exactamente igual que el Persona 5 Royal, y es incre\u00edble. Gr\u00e1ficamente no es top tier ni mucho menos, lo que quiz\u00e1s se lamenta es la inclusi\u00f3n de modelos mejorados, pero eso lo compensa excelentemente bien con su apartado art\u00edstico, que es igual de bueno que Royal.\nUn problema que me ocurri\u00f3 al igual que otros usuarios es el de los dientes de sierra que aparecen pese a tener activado el antialiasing. Por suerte esto se puede solucionar con el panel de control de Nvidia, pero es un claro problema que se tiene que solucionar con un parche.\n\nHISTORIA (SIN SPOILERS):\n\nEs digna de un Megami Tensei, los que jugaron alg\u00fan juego de esta franquicia ya me entender\u00e1n. No es una trama muy original, pero funciona. Los personajes nuevos encajan bien y no se sienten forzados. La duraci\u00f3n, aproximadamente unas 40 horas son perfectas, si hubiese durado m\u00e1s me parec\u00eda malo.\n\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N:\n\nComprenlo, sin m\u00e1s. Divertido, entretenido, rejugable, bonito, etc. Repito, no importa que no hayas jugado otro juego de la saga, vale much\u00edsimo la pena y lo disfrutaran en demas\u00eda.\n0 comentarios  Suscribirse al hilo (?)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "487e9e54997953d496102547f5c10ef4", "author": "c58b02b3ed6956d59b1d9104e3472d2f", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 909, "content": "\u4f60\u4eec\u90fd\u8fd8\u597d\u554a\uff0c\u80fd\u8fc7\u5e8f\u7ae0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6536\u4e86\u7d22\u83f2\u4e9a\u540e\u8fde\u4f1a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90fd\u56de\u4e0d\u6765\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u95ea\u9000\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u529e\u6cd5\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u8d76\u7d27\u51fa\u8865\u4e01\u554a\uff01\uff01\u8bf7\u5404\u4f4dPC\u515a\u7559\u610f\uff0c\u6ca1\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u524d\u5f80\u522b\u4e70\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "91a1294d43355403bbe174093c89db34", "author": "625b32757b255dd39912273a965954ea", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 3596, "content": "P4G\u306f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6e08\u307f\u3002\nP5R\u306f\u672a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u7269\u8a9e\u306b\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u3051\u307c\u308a\u611f\u304c\u305f\u307e\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001\n\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u7684\u306b\u306f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002\n\u3059\u3067\u306b\u66f8\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u3082\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3082\u4eac\u90fd\u7de8\u3067\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3084CTD\u304c\u8d77\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u74b0\u5883\uff1aRyzen5 2600+Radeon RX470\uff08\u6700\u65b0\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\uff09\n\u3053\u307e\u3081\u306a\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u3067\u51cc\u3050\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044\u304b\u306a\u30fc\u3068\u3002\n\u307b\u304b\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3082\u3063\u3068\u9177\u3044CTD\u8d77\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3057\u3002\n\u6226\u95d8\u306f\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3048\u3070\u3001\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u306d\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u304b\u3089\u306eShowTime\u3068\u304b\u3002\n\u3067\u3082\u5f8c\u534a\u306b\u884c\u304f\u307b\u3069\u3001\u6226\u95d8\u304c\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u611f\u3058\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001P4G\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u304b\u306a\u3002\n\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u7269\u8a9e\u306f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\u3042\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3067\u3082\u3001\u3053\u306e\u304a\u5024\u6bb5\u3067CTD\u3059\u308b\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u306d\uff1f\nBugFix\u3068\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7b81c6f1df115031b7b6f371877c85db", "author": "de8a649db1d8544895dcb4eae7df8f80", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 106, "content": "As someone whose first experience with Persona was Persona 4 Golden on Steam. I was pretty confused when I bought Strikers thinking it is Persona 5.. but it's actually a sequel to Persona 5. \nFrom whatever few hours I played I can't really draw a proper conclusion whether I like the game or not, since I didn't want to play a sequel to a game I haven't even tried yet. So obviously I refunded my purchase. \n\n\n- Personally I vastly preferred Persona 4 style combat a LOT more. So that's about the only point I can make from the limited time I played the game. \n\nI'll make this review a negative one, because I feel like it's pretty stupid to release a sequel to a game that isn't on the platform plus the combat felt uninteresting as I stated previously, though I can't say if only playing for 2 hours gave me enough depth to make such a call, but I'm not about to find out before P5 is out. \n\n*I will re-do this review after they hopefully release Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal on Steam*", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 10, "funny": 5, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0e72a8c109cc59fa85daaeaaa3f3438f", "author": "f2a86186d273582a8ced10a02d596e62", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 3278, "content": "Finished the game, it was a blast to play from start to finish.\n\nI know many people thought that when this game was first announced its just some 3d arena fighter spin off but after playing the game, it still feels like a fully fleged Persona 5 experience. It has a lot of what i wanted in the original Persona 5, the phantom thieves acting more like friends rather than teammates, because everyone is introduced immediately, the game has freedom for you to see them acting as friends, the writing is consistently witty and actually funny and not forced, and even while going through the \"palaces\" of the game (which they are called jails now), there is so much idle and situational dialogue it genuinely feels great to see everyone interacting with each other. \n\nThe combat is smooth and slick and keeps the absolute overwhelming sense of style as in the games prior, every character has their own gimmicks and unlockable techniques if you play as them for long enough, adding something new and it never once felt as if im forcing myself through battles, when you're strong, the game makes you feel like it and its just so cool.\n\nThe story and new characters we're also very interesting and the final parts of the game felt very reminiscent of the final palace of Persona 5 Royal, which is a nice touch, you also unlock the og Persona 5 and Persona 5 royal battle music after beating the game, as well as some extra things that add replay value to the game.\n\nThe only downside is, as I'm sure you've heard, the game is not a stranger to crashing, while my game has crashed only twice, i suggest saving very often when you are playing the game since when you crash, you have to go back to your latest save file,  hopefully these problems get fixed. \n\ntldr: its a very great experience and more of the Phantom thieves we know and love, with a DRIPPY soundtrack and combat, i say it's worth the price, i cans see the love that went into this game. It can crash but the only way to remedy that for now is to just save as often as you can.

BUT, there is some issues that is holding back the game of its full potential, this includes, game crashes and a bit of camera problem.\n[b] P.S:[/b] i added spoiler text, be warned.\n\n[b]- Crashes:[/b] i have gotten several crashes/freezes toward my playthrough in P5S, First crash is during [spoiler] Alice's [/spoiler] jail, during this Jail, i have gotten a crash that made 3 or 4 of my first hours worthless as i did not save and had to start at the beginning where i met Sophia. Second, is a freeze,after the gang defeated [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] and leave the Jail, it suddenly froze and i wasn't even sure if it was loading or not since there was no phantom thieves Logo.\n\n[b]-camera issues:[/b] for me, the camera was a bit annoying as it started to clip through objects like trees and walls, making it hard to see. easily can copy the camera movement from other hack and slash game (dynasty warriors or god of war 1,2 or 3) but did not and feels like the camera is fighting agaisnt me.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]  the game is amazing, The story, the returning characters, the new characters, the twist, the adventure. But there are way to many problems in this current build and is holding the game back. Wait till patches and updates come out for the game if you are thinking of purchasing this game.\n\n[b] edit:[/b] also, after the [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] boss fight, my game wouldn't load, i have restarted the game even my computer numerous times, i cannot continue onward after that, so the game is unplayable for me, please fix this issue ASAP.\n\n[b] edit 2: [/b] so, after Atlus/Sega fix the issues by giving it a more stable platform shape as a hotfix, i can finally continue the game. After finishing it, one thing is certain, it a rollercoaster of emotions and after they fix it, definitely recommend this game to Persona lovers, even thought its no longer a  J-RPG, they certainly put the effort to make the hack and slash aspect better. Now, i can finally say with certainty...i definitely Recommend this game.", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "364c0472b3f4504984d235365298e748", "author": "59e9f90cc923570d8c3190cea689b794", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 211, "content": "\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e15\u0e34\u0e14\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c Persona \u0e21\u0e32\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e20\u0e32\u0e04\u0e41\u0e23\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e08\u0e19\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 Persona 5  \u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e43\u0e04\u0e23\u0e14\u0e39\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e21\u0e30\u0e08\u0e1a\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e08\u0e1a\n\u0e41\u0e19\u0e30\u0e19\u0e33\u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e21\u0e30 \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e34\u0e19\u0e46\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cc92794f55f05e45ba9fd83006774bb5", "author": "0ee1808ee8045420993b46592ab762c5", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1161, "content": "Tiene lo stile di Persona 5 anche cambiando lo stile di combattimento.\nPer essere un Mosou \u00e8 ben pensato anche a livello di trama e mantiene ci\u00f2 che rende Persona un gioco famoso.\nMi piace e lo consiglio a tutti i fan della serie, ma se non avete mai giocato Persona 5 sar\u00e0 difficile entrare nel mondo.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1928438acf3851bb8696d249c1c34386", "author": "9d5c07a5099d5217b147ff383db3f89a", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 1419, "content": "Great game!

A mixture of perfect classic persona story and dynasty warriors type gameplay. The game takes several aspects from the original Persona 5, in terms of plot points and themes.

Easy answer, yes! Complicated answer, wait a little bit.\nFirst, as much as Atlas says this is a standalone title, it really isn't. As far as I gotten into the game, there were many past references to the original Persona 5 game (unfortunate how it's only on ps4/ps5 for now\u2026) If you haven't already, play the first game. Ignore royal, waste of time haha. Besides that, I would consider it a direct sequel to Persona 5. Ever play Bayonetta (a very fun game as well, totally recommend)? It's very similar to Strikers, pretty much going into the \u201chack and slash category\u201d. I would suggest you use a controller too unless you have long flexible fingers. Keybinds for keyboard are kinda all over the place, so if you have the patience unlike me, Strikers supports change of keybinds (controller still recommended). Now, performance wise\u2026. Considering that it's a new game, there are lots of random crashes, and bugs here and there which ruins the entire persona experience, which is why I believe you should wait to buy this game till a patch gets pushed out. BUT! This game is great, takes elements from its different titles and mixes them. You will definitely know it's a Persona game, because of its catchy music and cool game art esthetics. 10/10.\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f81ee11ffbcc5372bcac638ddf7edf66", "author": "c242fe34f1ed5c4ea687148e2cfd21a8", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 2265, "content": "I've put a lot of hours into both Warriors games and Shin Megami Tensei games - and I enjoyed the original Persona 5, so I was excited to play Strikers. Now, having beaten the game, I can say that Strikers is one of the stronger games in its genre.\n\nThe gameplay of Strikers makes it a very enjoyable game. The game mixes the beat-em-up gameplay of Warriors games and the adventure gameplay of Persona, with some sprinkling of what feels like an Ys game. You'll progress through dungeons fighting Shadow after Shadow as the Phantom Thieves, and is what you'll spend most of your time doing. Each member of the Phantom Thieves have distinct skills and fighting styles, with my favorites being Inari's ice/counter and Noir's Psi/Gun fighting styles. This hasn't been the first time Persona has taken a step out of the comfort zone, and this game does it well. Unfortunately, this gameplay change also does away with the day-to-day life-sim aspect that Persona's iconic for in favor of a more linear schedule - time won't progress until you do the objective. This in turn removes the Confidant system (in favor of Bond XP leveling system), so any character-fleshing-out is going to only happen during the story. This isn't a huge turn-off for me, but for how much this game feels like just an action-Persona title, it's a shame that sort of thing wasn't included.\n\nStrikers is also very strong aesthetically. It hasn't changed much from Persona 5, but that isn't a bad thing. Exploring the dungeons, while admittedly formulaic at times, remains enjoyable over the 30 hour journey due to not only the enjoyable combat, but also due to varying environments and soundtrack. New songs add to the ambiance of dungeon exploration, while remixes of old Persona 5 favorites pumping energy into the combat. Like its predecessor, Strikers is very strong stylistically.\n\nFor better or for the worse, the story is very much what you would expect from an SMT game - [spoiler]  teenagers fighting ever stronger enemies until they kill god [/spoiler]. Still, I think the strongest parts of an SMT story is represented in its characters. While the Phantom Thieves have their time to shine, much more of the spotlight is given to new characters Sophia and Zenkichi, so it's a good thing these characters are likable.  I found Sophia to be very adorable and good comic relief, with Zenkichi being even stronger comic relief. It's a shame they get more of a focus than the original team, but they're well written enough to be enjoyable elements of the story.\n\nThis game is not standalone; I do not think you can play Strikers without expecting to be spoiled with the plot of Persona 5. Various plot elements of the previous game are talked about in Strikers - such as plot and ending elements of Persona 5, or retroactively spoil the original game - why are characters in the original game not in this one? If you're already familiar with the plot of the original or Royal or don't care about being spoiled, you can jump right in, but otherwise I cannot recommend this as the starting point of Persona 5 newcomers.\n\nThe one major gripe I have with Strikers is the sole technical issue I've had with the game - the crashes. Roughly during every session I play the game - after about two to four hours - the game will crash, usually during a transition between dungeons and Japan or traveling to/from the Velvet room. I save rather aggressively, so I basically never lost any progress, but if you're worried about that sort of thing and rely on autosaves you should probably wait for a future patch.\n\nTLDR: Persona 5 Strikers is a worthy sequel to Persona 5, featuring charming characters, engaging combat, and a great aesthetic. Any fan of both of Persona and Warriors based combat is sure to enjoy this game, but people who haven't yet experienced Persona 5 or wary of crashes should purchase in the future instead.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1624a70f2c11507492e5f444b684c889", "author": "1ce06aeaaff7539f9cd8971f9983084b", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 2572, "content": "I love persona and I love musou and this is the best musou game ever put on pc and pretty much anywhere. it's stylish it has some difficulty to it the story is way beyond whatever a normal musou game has.

Persona 5 is my favourite game of all time, and this sequel just makes me love the first even more.\n\nThe gameplay is a little hard to get used to, and sometimes there's a bit of level gaps, so do try to battle every enemy when possible. If I had to describe the gameplay, I would say it's something similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake, more than a traditional warriors game. It has dungeon crawling elements as opposed to just attacking a bunch of enemies on a map, and its honestly pretty good for a spin-off.\n\nOverall if you love Persona 5, this game is a must.

I myself used the nvidia control panel fixes (plus setting the exe to run as admin) and it has completely solved the load time and load crash issues I've suffered. (as far as I can tell atleast)\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, yes even those that have already played Persona 5. First off this game is fully based on the Persona 5 Original version of the world, not the Royal remake. If this bothers you please keep in mind that this game was released in Japan long before Royal was made. Keep in mind that this game also happens after the events of P5 so I fully recommend you play P5 first unless you came here specifically for the combat system over the story, at that point you'll be fine most of the major plot points revolve around current happenings anyways, I myself came for the story so...\n\nPoint on the combat system. If you already played P5 or P5 Royal you might have issue with the combat system as it takes the, beat the life out of waves of enemies with everything you got, approach over the turn-based quality over quantity enemies that the mainline games have. The fusion system is slightly simplified as is the persona strengthening system. You are slightly screwed out of you're previous sources of items, armor, and weapons, but in turn you have and adorable new character who will handle most of your material needs. You also have Joker's awakened cooking abilities and a 100% fixed flow of time, also UNLIMITED TRANSIT between the real world and the metaverse, due to the shorter in-game time you are given to clear the palace. DAYS WILL ONLY PASS ALONGSIDE STORY PROGRESSION. No getting bad ends because you spent to long getting pestered by Mona to sleep. There is also a million other little things you'll learn as you play that differ from the mainline games but you'll learn them fairly easily.\n\nI dearly love the Persona games alongside it's older edgier cousin. And so far the game has been amazing for a spin-off of a spin-off series. You do have to look at it like persona Q in that it is fairly different from the game or games that it spawned from. Igor is once again eating popcorn far away from the side disaster probably drinking tea with his boss. So just, realize that like a lot of games, you won't know how much you'll enjoy a game till you play it or see the systems in action.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a789d75ea4c35cedb1047c92d8894f23", "author": "cc0d1c553eaa503a9d2c39fcadfdb307", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 3262, "content": "While this game is a great sequel to the Persona 5 storyline, the gameplay is wildly different that some players may be put off at first if they were just expecting another Persona 5.\n\nReally need to have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal to understand the background of a lot of the characters and appreciate the connection a lot of them experience in the game. The story itself is pretty stand-alone, but the interactions that some of the characters experience or reference aren't.\n\nCombat itself, while intensely different from the mainline game, is quite enjoyable both from the standard attacks, various ways the different characters you can control function, the way weaknesses are handled, all the way to the All-Out Attacks not just being a 1-hit KO necessarily. All of the systems provide depth to the combat, but don't complicate it too much to allow the player to still fully master it in the course of normal gameplay.\n\nStory, Voice Acting, Music, all are Top Notch just like the mainline Persona 5 game. All are accentuated by no Confidant system being in this game like in Persona 5. While that might be a detriment in some aspects of truly getting to know some characters and having more 1-on-1 interactions between characters, it can also help keep the story going at a smooth pace with how the 'dungeons' are laid out.\n\nBoth a pro and a con at the same time in different aspects, is the fact that there is no time/day management in this game like in the Persona mainline games. This means that there's not as much planning needed for those that were hoping for that aspect. However, it also means that players can go back and truly explore and 100% the 'dungeons' and such without worry that they will miss something because they mismanaged their in-game time/dates.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5dfbe4ebc4a55d539f37c6c26d36f067", "author": "280ba80f0d29506bbdc3ec60153762cf", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 978, "content": "A real sequel to vanilla p5 and hopefully the next step to get persona games on pc", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cb12715416b95299abe19575d6e978e4", "author": "42ed65c2e4e85eaba8697c9378fe3467", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 4906, "content": "EDIT: Ok, I've tentatively changed my review for now because I've played a lot since I first made it and haven't experienced any more crashes.

First, according to other reviews, the crashes are still a major issue for some people, so I might have just gotten lucky, and people should be aware of it. Second, I think it pretty accurately expresses what I love about the game.\n\nIf they fix the crashes, this is an amazing game. If they fix the crashes, I can give this a positive review. If they fix the crashes, I can talk about how this game brings back the same feeling I had playing Persona 5. If they fix the crashes, I would recommend this to both Musou and Persona fans alike. If they fix the crashes, I can say that this actually feels like it would even appeal to people who weren't ever fans of either. Please fix the crashes, This game obviously had a lot of effort and love poured into it, especially for something that I was expecting to be a quick cash-grab. There's no reason it should have the negative reviews that it does. It truly is amazing if only it lacked the technical issues.

Don't get me wrong I do like that system. This game is more easy to understand and defeat enemy opponents as you get to know their weakness from the start with the third-eye ability and Futaba analysing the enemy mid & start of combat. Which makes sense since this game is based right after the original Persona 5 game. So Joker would know all enemies weakness and what persona mask he should use to strike their weakeness.\n\nWhen you have the correct characters while in the jail you can then use them to strike the enemy weakness and do massive amounts of damage, they do have environmentals attacks in sum jails that can alleviate the problem of accidentally initiating combat with characters that do not have the correct abilities to strike the enemy weakness. On the other hand, you can just max out Joker's slots with persona masks from fusion or the compendium in the velvet room, and hope he has the right mask with the right ability to strike the enemy weakness during that combat situation but that's inefficient as it would just deplete Jokers stamina making him useless, unless you pump him with items that can recover his SP.\n\nHowever, a solution they can introduce is that I would loved for them to bring back the ability to switch out characters during combat by idk a bond upgrade since they removed the social aspects from the game.\n\nAnother thing I kinda dislike is the inventory system, I hate having to pause the combat to then scroll down a ton of purchased items to find the correct item to use to for example recover SP to a character that's out of stamina. \n\nA solution they could add to fix this would be a redesign in which they categories the inventory to have HP items in one section, SP items in another and lastly the curables ailments items in different sections for quick and easy location and applying the item on said character that needs it.\n\nI will not mention story as I would like to not spoil it for any persona fan that hasn't played it but overall it a good hack and slash game and story in my opinion does seem kinda rushed but it's great.\n\nFor price, I would loved to have paid \u00a310 less but I'm still happy with my purchase. As the game is fun and enjoyable.

I'm usually not a fan of Musou game, but this one actually includes a lot of the Persona 5 identity from the main game, and it's always a pleasure to meet the Phantom Thieves one more time !\nHowever, I can't recommend the game right now because of one single (big) issue : the random crashes. In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cd210092aff15a659226fe819aba5b37", "author": "99113621b2285b69bbbedeabdc5dc127", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 6947, "content": "Il Gioco in generale quindi un buon seguito del capitolo precedente persona 5, il fatto che sia in italiano ma sopratutta il fatto di averlo messo pure sul pc", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5b0f37939d44579d8659b8870075d8ca", "author": "79992124d9b75f0fadd44c483c10c9da", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 7307, "content": "Dear Atlus\n\nThanks for releasing this game in the west, I'd nearly given up hope on playing this one. \nMore importantly, based on the success of P4 Golden and now Strikers on steam and that my PS4 is not going to last forever,\n\nIMMORTALIZE P5 ROYAL ON STEAM\n\nThank You\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f75ddf8d0925f62925e718c211aa8a9", "author": "110fdb2ada9e5c42abcdd891ec666dfa", "date": "2021-02-27", "hours": 4079, "content": "great addition to the persona series.

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "379d1660242754e1a2a0cc716623b533", "author": "66d326f1fa165eb9b7a16676e53be354", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 7343, "content": "A pretty good sequel to persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2628b92ed9e05204a176961d89dbbe2a", "author": "b8fb646409c859bea5dacd56dbf50273", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2852, "content": "Nothing's more satisfying than blasting through countless enemies while Daredevil plays.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f7d6351d697e5223880b17563c9bc194", "author": "66a60b08ed6355fc8d04eb76a445187c", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 1017, "content": "If your a fan of beat down style games, give this a try.

I can't say I did that with Persona 5 Strikers because I was so dang excited to play this game.\n\nUpon finishing, I'm happy. Some people say this is a good template for future games, but they're wrong. This is a definitive and refined version of a Persona 5 sequel, but it lacks the emotional depth and sense of time that makes the mainline games so compelling and amazing.\n\nBut what Strikes does well is get the gang who you've already enjoyed a 70-110 hour game with, and take you on another adventure with them. This is a game for those of you who maxed the Confidants in Persona 5, spent a year in Tokyo stealing hearts, and decided you want just a little bit more.\n\nI enjoyed the road trip aspect, as it feels like a more grown up theme than a growing up theme - one of my rites of passage into adulthood was travelling with friends, and Strikers captures that perfectly. This is a game that has grown up with people who played Persona 5 a few years back.\n\nWith that in mind, the writing is solid. Sometimes the characters feel like archetypes, but that's par for the course of a Persona sequel. I see it as more akin to the characters being more comfortable in their own skins, openly being parodies of themselves in a lighthearted fashion. It's also not as on the nose as, say, Persona Q was in this regard, so that's a good thing. I went along with it, at least.\n\nMy biggest reservation was that Omega Force were developing it. I hate Musou games, and I won't lie, when this was first announced I felt a pit in my stomach - I asked myself if this would this be a Persona game I skipped. Thankfully, it's more RPG than Musou to its benefit. I still prefer the turn-based combat, and I miss the Confidants/S.Links, but the action RPG combat complements the more streamlined Persona experience in general, giving the game a sense of pace that isn't needed in a mainline release. I'm amazed that they pulled it off, but they did.\n\nAbout the only flaws, for me at least, with Strikers are the bugs. When it works, the game runs like a dream, but there are some visual glitches in All Out Attacks that are jarring, and the amount of times the game crashed or froze was, frankly, unacceptable. I'm hoping Atlus/Omega Force go in and fix these issues, but I can't help but feel it's tainted my experience. My best advice to deal with them is save often and hope the game doesn't crash during a long story segment.\n\nBugs aside, this is a solid game. It's not a groundbreaking title, but it is a solidly made game that sets out to do a thing and does it. If you've played Persona 5 and wanted one more adventure with the Phantom Thieves, this is \u00a355 well spent.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ed6f436d52c1587d9c609ebd1e067c9d", "author": "771a8acabea55a6a94f1c91ffc7207c3", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 29023, "content": "goofy, but actually a really good sequel. some great mini character arc conclusions for the thieves, music slaps, and just fun to play through in general ( also to replay on merciless is actually good). sophia and zenkichi are peak additions.

I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed.

While it certainly draws inspiration from the genre for its core combat, Strikers goes above and beyond in making the game its own, rather than solely adopting the warriors style and nothing else.\n\n[b]The story[/b] follows up several months after the events of the original Persona 5 game. The crew eager for summer vacation discover the metaverse is still active and people are manipulating a new AI program, \"EMMA,\" to steal the desires of those around them for various reasons. They take to the road to sniff out these \"Jails\" and steal back the desires of the public. All in all, the story is pretty fun for what it is, but don't be expecting the same heavy hitting and deeply metaphoric narrative structure Persona 5 had delivered. Strikers definitely reigns it back a bit, and plays out more like a fun action anime tale.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is pretty addictive. Being a fan of warriors games in the first place, I'm naturally drawn to hack 'n slash fun, but Strikers adds many of its own series' elements to the formula to spice things up. First, you are no longer on a day-by-day system when using the metaverse. Rather, you can phase to-and-fro reality as you please to restock and refresh. The fight encounters are similar to the original persona game, but then the hack 'n slash starts. The key factor here, is that you will be fighting basic shadow hordes, but a lot of Personas as well. This means you have to watch out for your own weaknesses and debuffs, but you can use your team's personas to fight against them as well.\n\nPersona registration, fusion, and strengthening are still here, and being able to collect, mix, and level up personas and skills to help you fight different types of enemies is addictive and just fun.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: of course its great I don't even need to say anything.\n\nIf this game lacks anything, its simply being a spinoff means there are no social links, variable dialogue or story options, etc. Its a very linear action game, so besides your personas and equipment the sense of control and planning isn't really there. But this makes sense, as its is a different class of game, mixing in elements from its true form.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of hack 'n slash games to enjoy this. If you love action games with flashy visuals and great music, this is for you. And if you simply LOVE persona 5, this is definitely for you, as the entire existence of Strikers simply stands as fan service for the biggest of fans.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a272e090d53e526dac78796a3fda30fd", "author": "91a11b178bd550b79add6ad27a5f958d", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 5792, "content": "so good\nedit: very good actually", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5e026fa810b553c09bbf7bda9eafdd93", "author": "3029e5badab25d6a852f06a8e3a6067d", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 78, "content": "Enjoying it so far.

Kommt aber nicht an Persona 5 (Royal) ran. \u00dcberfl\u00fcgelt aber andere Musou-Spiele (Massengekloppe). Es ist ein Persona mit anderem Gameplay. Nicht ein Musou mit Story.\n\nMan sollte Persona 5 (Royal) vorher gespielt haben. Es werden Sachen aus dem Hauptspiel gespoilert. Das klassische Persona 5 reicht dabei aus (welches f\u00fcr mich auch etwas besser war als Royal), da Strikers an dessen Handlung ankn\u00fcpft.\nWer Persona 5 gemocht hat, wird auch mit Strikers gl\u00fccklich werden.\n\n[b]Zur Einordnung[/b]\nIch habe von den Entwicklern folgende Spiele durchgespielt:\nvon Atlus: Catherine, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 und Persona 5 Royal\nvon Omega-Force: Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\n\nPersona 5 war f\u00fcr mich eines der besten Spiele, die ich je gespielt habe, dementsprechend voreingenommen war ich bei Strikers.\n\nDer Atlus-Teil (Story) ist deutlich besser, als der Omega-Force-Teil (K\u00e4mpfe). Ich h\u00e4tte mir hier die Rundenk\u00e4mpfe gew\u00fcnscht, obwohl ich generell Action-Games lieber mag. \nMan l\u00e4uft nicht \u00fcber eine Karte und muss Punkte wie bei anderen Musou-Spielen einnehmen, sondern hat ein Dungencrawling wie in Persona 5, eben nur mit einem anderem Kampfsystem. Strikers hat aber einen absolut fantastischen Soundtrack und Artstyle.\n\n[b]Technik[/b] (Patch-Stand: Ver. 1.00)\nRTX 2070, AMD Ryzen 7 2700X, 16 GB Ram\nDas Spiel ist bei mir 5x angeschmiert. Wenn man oft speichert verliert man nicht so viel, weil man die Dialoge schnell wegdr\u00fccken kann. Im Dungeon kann man sehr oft speichern.\nDas Spiel ist bei 60 FPS gecappt. Ich hatte meistens nur 50 FPS, manchmal auch mehr oder weniger. Es hat aber nicht sehr gest\u00f6rt.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nBei Strikers steht die Story im Mittelpunkt und ist das Glanzst\u00fcck. Sie nimmt sehr viel Zeit im Spiel ein, deswegen sind die K\u00e4mpfe nicht ganz so belastend wie in Hyrule Warriors. Man hat immer sehr lange Pausen zwischen den Dungeons und der Story. Trotzdem darf man nicht ein Persona-Ausma\u00df erwarten, man hat nicht den klassischen Tagesablauf. Die Story ist sehr geradlinig, hat aber viele Wendungen. Sie f\u00fcgt sich gut an das Ende von Persona 5 an und hat mir deutlich besser gefallen, als das was in Persona 5 Royal hinzu kam. Die \"Story\" aus Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ist gar nichts dagegen.\n\n[b]K\u00e4mpfe[/b]\nDie K\u00e4mpfe sind auch besser gemacht, als bei anderen Musou-Spielen, weil man bei jedem Encounter alle Gegner besiegen muss und durch die Charaktere und Persona viele Optionen hat.

The story is well written, and feels like a true successor to the ORIGINAL Persona 5.\n\n With no references to Royal, due to the different teams in different studios working on these games side by side, it leaves itself open to, potentially, DLC. I would hope for it, but it's doubtful as the game has already been out in Japan for a year without any mention of DLC. It's a fantastic game, if you're a Persona fan, don't let the idea of the combat turn you off, it's executed very well, and more in line with a Persona game that's taking queues from action titles than it does something like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and they've never felt more agile or more stylish, and they're ready to steal your heart once more.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8280341f01e05b4c8d909358fc21f7bf", "author": "317c227d455d5e7794236aa31f249170", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 7776, "content": "muy buen juego\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ce755cf16d9456d0b7e100a1bd9f77df", "author": "5bc2893bb08d5313b62a22e3e1a7fda2", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 3706, "content": "Music great, gameplay good characters bestest.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "768c00d4817652f1801928acaa357358", "author": "1f58d26254895e909f46ca8c49122f09", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 8337, "content": "Pretty good game.

However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 53, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "76c94a1f807059f2b3599bbc33eab52b", "author": "92c972bc852f5a64be1a17d045a0724e", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2885, "content": "\u4eba\u306b\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u306b\u4fdd\u7559\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u304c\u5207\u306b\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\n\u697d\u3057\u304f\u904a\u3093\u3067\u306f\u3044\u308b\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u7d9a\u7de8\u304b\u3089\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3068\u4e16\u754c\u89b3\u3068\u304b\u4eca\u3072\u3068\u3064\u306e\u3081\u308a\u3053\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3067\u3066\u304d\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u306a\u30fc\u3068\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u307e\u3042\u307e\u3042\u697d\u3057\u304f\u904a\u3093\u3067\u308b\u306e\u304b\u306a\n\u3067\u3082\u4e57\u308a\u5207\u308c\u306a\u304f\u3066\u6b8b\u5ff5\u3060\u3068\u3044\u3046\u611f\u60f3\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\n\n\u79c1\u306e\u5834\u5408P4G\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3059\u304e\u3066\u6211\u6162\u3067\u304d\u305a\u306b\u3053\u308c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\n\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u672c\u7de8\u304b\u3089\u3084\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3060\u306a\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u306e\u304c\u7d50\u8ad6\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\n\n\u30dc\u30b9\u786c\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\n\u3053\u3053\u307e\u3067\u786c\u3044\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3068\u304b\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4f5c\u696d\u611f\u304c\n\n\u3042\u3068\u73fe\u72b6\u305f\u307e\u306b\u843d\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u306f\u76f8\u5f53\u3053\u307e\u3081\u306b\u3057\u305f\u307b\u3046\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u30b5\u30d6\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u53ce\u96c6\u3092\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3061\u843d\u3061\u3066\u30d1\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3068\u304d\u306e\u865a\u7121\u611f\u3068\u3044\u3063\u305f\u3089\n\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u306f\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u958b\u767a\u8005\u53cc\u65b9\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306a\u306e\u3067\n\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u5e38\u306b\u5b9f\u88c5\u3057\u3066\u304a\u304f\u7656\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3066\u304a\u3044\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\n\n\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u76ee\u3092\u3064\u3076\u308b\u611b\u306f\u62b1\u3051\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8c51ce5156505a03843c350c1136dfdc", "author": "cc659d681bc15efca25de1039d0dad6a", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 3907, "content": "An amazing journey, I enjoyed every second. 9.5/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "12deeffe05ca510c984fa35139723413", "author": "bbe8faf625ac5b9d8054c7004176c268", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 3013, "content": "\u8fd8\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u4ed6\u662f\u65e0\u53cc\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6211\u633a\u559c\u6b22\u73a9\u65e0\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e0d\u503c400\uff0c\u672c\u4eba\u4e70\u7684\u662f\u8c6a\u534e\u7248\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u662f\u89c9\u5f97\u6709\u70b9\u8d35\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5176\u4ed6\u60f3\u8981\u5165\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u7b49\u964d\u4ef7\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5165\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u4e70\u8c6a\u534e\u7248\uff0c\u8c6a\u534e\u7248\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u4ef6\u88c5\u5907\u548cbgm\u6ca1\u5565\u7684\u4e86\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8bf4\u4e00\u53e5\uff0c\u6211\u662fsb", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e55e7ac8e6fa521d9b7ee88738192f4e", "author": "dc420faa820c5c4d8ab6214a46883cd6", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 825, "content": "Does a good job at blending the game-play and style of the warriors and persona series, if you're looking for big battles like in the more traditional warriors games this doesn't have those but rather it has a series of smaller skirmishes with more variety in the normal enemies.

This direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 plays similar to the Warriors type games but there are differences that make it feel much more Persona than I had originally expected. For instance, the story is incredibly prevalent and includes longer scenes as you may be used to from Persona. Weaknesses still play a massive role as well. Where I had originally expected a similar style of combat to Dynasty Warriors, I was pleasantly surprised at the tactical depth of this game; button mashing isn't going to get you very far. I would probably say it's more similar to Kingdom Hearts in that regard.\n\nAfter 40 hours, I can say I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. It's very well stylised and I am happy to be playing it on PC. That being said, I - and as far as I've seen, many others as well - have been experiencing crashes. Make sure to save at every chance you have and you shouldn't ever lose much progress. This still screams for a patch, though.\n\nBesides this, my only annoyance is that the menus are relatively slow to navigate. Again, they're very stylish, but having an animation between every sub-menu makes it a bit tedious sometimes. Could just be me, though.\n\nIn short, extremely fun game, plagued by the occasional crash.

I know a lot of people REALLY want to play this game on PC, but when you are so insistent on endlessly complaining about it, you just look really pathetic.\n\nAlso x3, this games soundtrack absolutely SLAPS.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3eafb9623d755f03ad2cc8ff0d24d9e2", "author": "61460e18433055978ed8aca235e52098", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 610, "content": "So Strikers is basically a sequel to Persona 5. got lost for a second 10/10 still fun though. hopefully ATLAS brings us Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 33, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5e2fb7e0181e585aa79bfcb9da74d30e", "author": "cf9080e0d67e5787aeed424ba1fbe655", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2833, "content": "\u4f60\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u628awin11\u517c\u5bb9\u4e86", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "47c938fec6c15e8d9f77ea735c46bc08", "author": "f81888fccbaa57639f0514007423d23d", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 3371, "content": "[h1]Before I start, lemme first suggest you to not buy the deluxe edition.[/h1]\nBonuses, including the soundtrack, are locked behind an app. Which means you can't listen to it on another device, or in your favorite media player.\n\n[h2]Now, the game itself...[/h2]\nWell, the game itself is pretty good.\n\nIt is important to [b]note that this is a sequel to Persona 5 (Not Royal)[/b], you can play it and kind of understand it without having played P5, but you'll enjoy it much more with knowledge of the events preceding the game. This game further develops the characters from P5 and brings new ones to the table, which are all pretty well written.\nSo far, the story is pretty decent, nothing stellar, though it's hard for me to judge, not having finished the game yet.\n\nGameplay is a solid mix between Persona 5 elements (Elemental weaknesses, baton pass, all out attacks, and of course personas) and what you'd find in the warriors series of games (basically inane amount of enemies and unique character combos). Some people seem to think this game is a musou. I'd argue that while it borrows a lot from the genre, it is, in fact, mostly just an Action RPG, which is not a bad thing in the end. However, due to the nature of the game, this can easily feel repetitive after a while.\nDifficulty is a bit confusing though. Normal encounters often ends in seconds while bosses can be extremely frustrating at times.\n\nGraphically the game is decent, UIs are stylish as you'd expect from a Persona game, but... the anti-aliasing they use (FXAA) is terrible, and affects the UI, this is pretty bad. I really recommend to disable the game's AA and make use of [url=https://reshade.me/]reshade[/url]'s SMAA instead or, if your PC can handle it, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405510545]supersampling[/url] to make things look good.\n\nThe soundtrack is full of bangers, as you'd also expect from a Persona game. Some of the tracks here are the best Persona 5 and its spin-offs can offer. Play this with good headphones.\n\nNow... Not all is good. Be warned that the game is locked at 60/30 FPS and sometimes randomly crashes when loading cutscenes. Save often.\n\nIf you can handle its little flaws and quirks, then this game is a pretty solid entry in the Persona franchise. And a pretty good game overall.\n\n[h2]If you don't have the time, here's the tl;dr...[/h2]\n* Game is a sequel to Persona 5 and will be much more enjoyable if you played it before.\n* Game is not a musou. It's an Action RPG where encouters are made of massive amount of enemies. The battle system itself is a mix of mechanics you'd find in Persona and Musou games.\n\n+ Story is pretty good and the new characters are great.\n+ Battles are pretty fun.\n+ The soundtrack might contain some of the best tracks in the series.\n\n- The difficulty curve is pretty weird. Normal encounters are easy, bosses are frustrating.\n- Graphically \"decent\". The Anti-Aliasing is terrible.\n- Framerate lock. (60/30 FPS)\n- Game sometimes crashes.\n\n[h3]Obligatory \"Please bring Persona 5 Royal to PC pls\".[/h3]", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true,

Well, for one I want to encourage Atlus to release more Persona games on Steam and for two: I absolutely love Persona 5 and want to encourage P Team to make more games! \n\nAlthough, let's discuss this game, eh? It is based six months after the events of Persona 5 (Original, not Royal). I went into this game with low expectations, I thought it was going to be like Hyrule Warriors (which I did not like) or Age of Calamity (which I did like, kind of) it is not really like them at all. I was expecting some chaotic combat with no real logic and a lot of frustration but... I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe writing is fantastic, although being a Sojiro fan-girl I am entirely disappointed that he merely appears for the briefest of times and then is only mentioned in passing... and as our moral compass old guy replacement we get Not Sojiro. We poke our Phantom Thief noses into Not Sojiro's life a little too much and he winds up following us like a bewildered puppy. Now, don't get me wrong, I love when new characters are added but a little food for thought once you've played this game... \n\nThink about the entire the plot of this game - take Not Sojiro out of it and put Sojiro in his place and have some slight tweaking of the narrative (i.e. Sojiro's Government Job past coming back to haunt him) and all the dramatic stuff that happens with Not Sojiro instead happening with ya boy... that would be infinitely more meaningful than slotting in this random new guy who I didn't find myself attaching with as much as I think the game wanted me to. For instance there's one point - maybe half way through the game where something dramatic happens (trying to avoid spoilers) and the first thing I'd suspect Futaba to do in this situation is call Sojiro for help, and does she? No. I believe they're trying to imply she wants to be independent and not frighten him or something, but ... give us some credit here, she's a teenager. She'd call Sojiro.\n\nThere are a lot of other new characters that come in to play too, and they're all well written, even Not Sojiro, there I said it. All the characters and their dialogue, feels genuine. This isn't like a \"straight to video\" release with shoddy writing and no heart. You can tell a lot of love, passion and energy went into the writing and the localisation team did brilliant! I really enjoyed learning more about each of the Phantom Thieves and seeing sides of them relating to social issues we are all experiencing in the world now. Props to P5S' writing team, they did a good job of making the villains sympathetic and relatable.\n\nThe game does not have time management dilemmas like you'd find in P5 or P5R - you're more along for the ride with this one. There are a ton of side quests to do, making personas for the compendium is slick and much more intuitive than in P5 (I think so anyway), and whilst there is a bit of grind at points, the combat and game play overall is fantastically enjoyable, so many different ways to pummel enemies into dust. \n\nIt's fast paced, I enjoyed the fan service, I laughed out loud at a lot of the dialogue (as I said the writers did a stand out job!). My only gripe was Not Sojiro. But hey, I'm not a writer for P Team so what do I know!?\n\nSeriously though Persona is one of my all time favourite game series - 5 being my favourite (controversial, I know!) and I hope Atlus will release the older ones on Steam at some point and future releases too. I would recommend this game even if you're not good at fighting games (I'm not but I love this one!). The difficulty is fair and there are some bosses where you'll be unbelievably punished for one slip up but there are plenty of opportunities for revives and healing items to be used and learning to switch between all the characters took some time for me but once I got the hang of it I adored the combat.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "63b1eb83f7875d7d98a8dddf918135c0", "author": "f6c9d6c79315517ba6420cdd5dd50edd", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 359, "content": "\u8fd8\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u65e5\u4ea7\u4e00\u8d2f\u7684\u6c34\u51c6\u5c4e\u4e00\u6837\u5f97\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a20G\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7535\u8111\u8017\u80fd\u6bd4\u4ed6\u4eecCOD\u8fd8\u8981\u5927\u7535\u8111\u98ce\u6247\u6068\u4e0d\u5f97\u8f6c\u7684\u98de\u51fa\u53bb\uff0c\u7535\u8111\u914d\u7f6e\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5c31\u4e0d\u8981\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u5165\u624bPC\u7248\u3002\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4bb369ac39e953f4a0047001e396bc7c", "author": "7211a629dcd85234ae80e13dc7eec169", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 1196, "content": "\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u4e3b\u673a\u4e0a\u901a\u5173\u8fc7\u4e00\u904d\uff0cPC\u7248\u4e5f\u518d\u4e70\u4e00\u4efd\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u548c\u753b\u9762\u66f4\u52a0\u6d41\u7a0b\u8212\u670d\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e86\u3002\n\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\uff1a\n\u9ad8\u901f\u7684\u6218\u6597\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8d85\u71c3\u7684BGM\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u662f\u5149\u8363\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u65e0\u53cc\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u66f4\u504f\u5411ARPG\uff0c\u6ce8\u91cd\u961f\u4f0d\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u642d\u914d\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u65f6\u4e5f\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5404\u9879\u88c5\u5907\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u7b49\u7b49\uff1b\n\u4e0d\u592a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff1a\n\u5bf9\u4ece\u672a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7P5\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u4e0a\u4e0d\u597d\u7406\u89e3\uff0cPC\u7248\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ea\u9000\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6211\u672c\u4eba\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u751f\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ef7\u683c\u504f\u9ad8\uff0c\u89c2\u671b\u7684\u8bdd\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b49\u6253\u6298\u518d\u5165", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e579ce35d9565096bc001689e44860a8", "author": "d3f5095a285a59bda02b29323722e773", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 412, "content": "Hearing the melody of \" Beneath the mask \" intrusmental while riding a train to Yongen-Jaya in the beginning of the game is the best moment where you can feel that particular feeling : \" Home sweet home baby!!

The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5e59e30360295c2b90af922cfb0e3a3a", "author": "b10464f6c43050168e8e6b120171cf9c", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 855, "content": "\u8fd9\u80fd\u4e0d\u51b2?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fe8bf2ac0cec5c9bb68cc01203e60b52", "author": "f5a7bae400ed53e0830aaf47141a8eac", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 1769, "content": "\u95ea\u9000+\u65e0\u81ea\u52a8\u5b58\u6863\u6076\u6027bug\uff0c\u4eac\u90fd\u76d1\u72f1\u6253\u5b8c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9ed1\u5c4f\uff0ccnmd\u66b4\u529b\u79fb\u690d", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "adbac02f2d6f5b2290c64da54d7441cb", "author": "7a1cf7d21eb25256aeda624987b8654d", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 458, "content": "Game continuously crashes on screen transitions (like right after you completed a tough long gauntlet event, or after beating a boss) rendering all your progress moot.

It's not perfect by any means, but it's good. It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves and takes you on a fun adventure with the thieves again. The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c8d270df7e8515992197a0c6f53a969", "author": "14d8cdf9e4595ef9b5dfc6ddd3c59048", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 595, "content": "Summary: Gameplay is fun, a true sequel to Persona 5, but crashes, and a lack of good PC mainstay features makes it a bad purchase.\n\nHardware: \nR7 1700X \n16GB RAM\nGTX 1070\n2560x1080 75hz Monitor\n\nI have had roughly TEN crashes. The number of times this game crashes is absolutely insane.\nNot to mention, the default controls for the game are terrible with Keyboard and Mouse, making it damn near unplayable without a controller. And the keybind settings are mediocre at best.\n\nGraphical settings wise, the game lacks ultrawide support, which is a huge point against it for me personally. The game ALSO does not apparently support refresh rates above 60Hz (as modders have discovered it is apparently tied to game speed), meaning that I can't take full advantage of my 75Hz monitor. Most games also feature a way to pause when tabbed out, or to keep the game running, which P5S lacks, making some situations annoying (I.E. game pauses when I respond to a friend on discord, etc). Other than that, the game looks beautiful and I haven't had any minor or large graphical glitches yet.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that I'm able to clear up to an hours worth of content, and then the game crashes, making me replay it. Since the game is actually pretty tough on higher difficulties, and grinding isn't really a viable option, this is extremely frustrating. Until these issues are fixed, I CANNOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME. If you would like to support the Devs, purchase the game on another platform. Do NOT reward shitty ports.

It crashed on me many times, and I thought that I was having issues with my Bluetooth since I was playing on my Xbox One controller via BT. Nope. All my other games work fine playing many hours with my controller. This particular game just keeps crashing during some battles.\n\nThe game itself is pretty decent, but not amazing. I honestly take solace in that fact since it's not supposed to be a \"flagship\" persona game. So don't expect it to be your GOTY or anything. \n\nNot recommending it due to the performance issues, but definitely a buy for Persona fans.\n\n\nEdit: I wanna expand on the actual gameplay + story. \n\nThe story is mostly similar to regular P5 with a few 'villains' that need to have a change of heart. As the story progresses, you and the gang find a new one in the same fashion as the games prequel and some of your teammates may play a role in each as it might relate to them in some way. So, don't expect any change to the typical formula. (Atlus, if you're reading this, try something new)\n\nThe gameplay is a hack n'slash taking inspiration from some musou games. However, instead of hordes of them attacking you at a time, you ambush guards that spawn a group of enemies for you to fight. You can switch between your party to play as whoever you want and each of them have their own move sets. There are also special abilities that you can use to down enemies that are weak to them(similar to P5). The level designs are ok, but they're kind of a chore to run around in. I do like the dire shadow boss fights, though. The one main boss fight I was in was pretty decent, but nothing that really grabbed me into the fight through some sort of mechanic that would have kept me on my toes.\n\nWhat could have made it more fun is if they took note from the Batman Arkham games and allowed more freedom of movement. Joker is shown as being gymnastic and a bit of a freerunner. Imo, they should have taken aspect and expanded on it a bit. It doesn't necessarily have to be 1:1, but something more aligned with the cutscenes they show would be welcomed. It's not an open world game, I know, but maybe create some interesting ways to get to the objective?\n\nOverall: 8/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended":

This game is fun. It's a lot of fun. The combat is so much fun, it's fun to go looking for it instead of avoiding the JRPG vanilla Persona 5 which gets tiring after 100 battles of grinding. It also doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, you can ride a skateboard and run over shadows with it. You get to do realtime combat with all-out attacks, follow-ups, one-mores, technicals, persona skills/swapping, baton-passes, etc etc. It's a blast to play. I HIGHLY implore you play the game on Hard for your first run. This game NAILS hard mode so well. Unlike other games that make their higher difficulties bullshit and unfair, this game makes it fair. Not only are the enemies tougher, but so are you. You do more damage as well. Combined with dodging and countering, it makes for a super fun combat experience.\n\nThe story is pretty damn good so far too. It feels like a proper sequel to Persona 5, though any part of the game like the base game does feel a bit more empty / simplified. Keep in mind that this game is a sequel to the vanilla Persona 5, NOT ROYAL. All the characters are the same as ever and enjoyable to watch and interact with. While Confidants/Social-Links are not present, you still get to bond with your friends a good amount not only in combat but in the real-world through events; reminiscent of Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest complaint you'll probably hear from this game are the bugs. The game has this weird tendency to crash whenever you leave/enter the Metaverse. I'm unsure why. You can luckily save a lot in this game, especially right before you load a new area so it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance as long as you save. The game also has a 60fps cap and some poor Anti-Aliasing which I hope will be fixed with a patch. It's not enough to make the experience any less enjoyable, I just hope it's fixed soon because it may be more buggy depending on the hardware.\n\nOverall, very fun game. Definitely worth the price. It's around 50 hours I've seen from other playthroughs. Not too far off from the length of Persona 4. There's a good amount of fan-service here. I highly would not recommend this game if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal yet, as you probably won't have as much of an emotional connection with the characters / plot as you would with. The DLCs aren't very worth it in my opinion, unless you get them from the Deluxe version. The All-Out Attack Pack seems to be relatively worthless, while the Legacy BGM Pack is a bit pricey and only worth it if you're a big Persona fan.

Turn based RPGs have their fans, but there are many people who find their gameplay loops to be unengaging. Persona 5 Strikers does an amicable job of bridging the gap, bringing classic persona tropes and mechanics to a more action oriented gameplay style. \n\nThis is no Musso/Warriors game, at least not in the same style of Hyrule Warriors or One Piece Pirate Warriors. If anything this plays more like a faster paced Kingdom Hearts game, for better and for worse. This game oozes with style, and its gameplay mechanics are just deep enough to be interesting while not going too deep into combo centric button strings. \n\nThat said, it's far from perfect. First and most glaring are the crashing issues. This game needs you to save often, and a mistimed crash can erase a good bit of effort since saving while dungeon crawling is limited to checkpoints. A saving system like this is fine, but when your game will crash without warning- it makes the checkpoint system feel less like a stopgap and more like a slight to a player who lost 40 minutes of exploring because they didn't save. \n\nBeyond that, it's a direct sequel to Persona 5, which is not available on the PC. This doesn't make the game unenjoyable to new fans, but it does throw you right back into the action assuming you know most everything about the Phantom Thieves and their six months at Shujin Academy. Despite the gameplay being a perfect way to introduce someone not usually into RPGs into Persona- the story is perhaps the exact opposite. Although for those who played 5, or at least read some wiki pages to get some backstories, the story is a fun romp across Japan with some touching moments. \n\nAll in all, Strikers is a good game. I hesitate to call it great for I believe a lot of my personal enjoyment comes from getting to see these characters again and a drive to 100% the game. Be wary of glitches and crashes- they will ruin some of the fun and you need to be prepared for that. But if you want some fun action combat drenched in Persona 5's signature style with some more of the Phantom Thieves: it's certainly going to scratch that itch for you. Whether that itch is worth scratching is up for you to decide.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8fefab8e1c3059d2a63af4b56996c5bc", "author": "40cfdba92dfe52bc9d56010ab3b2f91d", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 3897, "content": "I prefer the other Persona games I have played to this one which is a bit repetitive in restock ingredients/dungeon crawl, but it is still an entertaining game.  7 out of 10.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "de1fe497915656328bb5bf34a54a0be0", "author": "a5b067abe1755031b02b46eb21c15056", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 104, "content": "\ub098\ub294 \ubcf8\ud3b8\uc774 \ud558\uace0\uc2f6\ub2e4", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4694c3cce5025b4fa24b0a39ec65ff16", "author": "a00bddf9614d5ae5bb287179536c4a17", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 744, "content": "goated", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "053f316097915d6a9077afa0da9afd60", "author": "ed7075fd2470532e9a4f2dd381fa8041", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 4236, "content": "It has futaba and i like futaba :)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "62cd0dc7bdc050418e025f17b64041f0", "author": "56aabb536c065bad916c56ef0d290f28", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2216, "content": "Its better than The last of us part 2 that's for sure.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a490e22562a15ce4a13bc1f1563a0c44", "author": "4f68f6673e7852c5966c59c08d72c54c", "date": "2021-02-26", "hours": 2801, "content": "Game is fun!\n\nJust like persona 5 but with diverse dynasty warriors combat and it keeps it's RPG qualities.

([b]reminder to play on hard mode![/b])\n\noh, and frequent use of baton pass increases enjoyment by a lot! however don't expect to like every party members playstyle right away! a lot of important moves are locked away and they all take some getting used to. in many cases i disliked playing as one but then i unlocked a new move and it all clicked. (pro tip: there are really great playstyle tips for all the characters in the tutorial menu, as well as the base combo moves listings)\n\nspeaking of which when playing on hard you will have to change your party composition constanty, which is definitely a hassle i do admit. basically since you can change party in between fights it's important to cycle out those who are low on health and SP. this also helps keep the XP distribution even.\n\ni will probably update this review when i have played more. i can't really put an arbitrary number on it but i can say that fans of persona 5 will definitively like this one. even if you don't like the gameplay (but i have a feeling you eventually will!) the story is enough to carry the experience.\n\ni was worried that although i  would like the game i wouldn't like it enough to feel i got 60 dollars worth. i can now confidently say that my fears were unfounded. thus far the game is going above my expectations and it seems to be a worthy 60 dollar title.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f0dbeeb32d245f619558d1c4044d2672", "author": "cffba32d4112555c9325f6c61426b5d0", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1900, "content": "Plays more like hack and slash Persona 5 and less like Dynasty Warriors, which is a good thing in my Book.

[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers (P5S) is best enjoyed if you played Persona 5 (P5) as it is best described as an amplified P5. The character quirks are more prevalent, the humour is more prevalent, many of the reused songs of P5 got more intense, and whether intentional or not the dialogue got A LOT more fellow-kiddy which only adds to the hilarity of it all.\n\nMuch of the music originates from P5 but they are complimented by just as many new songs for the new shop, activities, fights and metaverse locations so this is as solid as you would expect it with an added increased variety in music genres.\n\nFinally, while mementos do not exist anymore, the game has its own grinding mechanic affiliated with new requests awarding much more interesting rewards than the simple XP and money of memento requests of P5.\n\n\n[h1] ...yet also losing some of its original charm [/h1]\n\nThe social gameplay feels like a P5 lite with some systems absent, most notably the time management of activities, the levelling of social stats and the school in-class questions and exams. The absence of those systems also leads to a poorer diversity in world activities with shopping being the only real activity left. Even then, the majority of shopping is done in an all-in-one online shop with magic instant delivery (the game fails to provide a legitimate explanation for this although it tries to). It is a bit disheartening, but the new shop UI and song make up for it to some degree.\n\nCooking becomes a much more important part of the game, becoming more diverse and more invested with you being encouraged to scour all shops to find new recipes and ingredients and now contributes to the bond system replacing the P5 confidants.\n\nThe bond system allows for a certain level of customisation of your experience as instead of linear confidant progression, you can invest your skill points however you want, specialising in certain areas in the order that you want. \nThe bond progression is also more gameplay inclined, progressing as you play like a glorified XP bar, and while friends will give you missions to somewhat enrich their personality, those will have a much stronger \u201cRPG side quest\u201d flair to them rather than the personality or story focus of P5\u2019s confidant system.\nHowever, the gang evolves as a complete group more often and with significantly more voice acting than P5, you get to see a lot more chemistry between the different members than you did in the previous game.\n\n\n[h1] Combat, a successful conversion that stays true to its origins [/h1]\n\nMaking up for the less diverse real world, the metaverse has gotten an upgrade with a more vertical level design and Joker having gotten a lot more agile. Many more objects can be jumped on and off from but can also be interacted with in unique ways which will tie directly into combat.\n\nAnd combat is the biggest change of this game, switching from turn based to a hack and slash which is, overall, a success. Everything you learnt from P5 is still here: personas, all out attacks, knock downs, elemental affinities and weaknesses, gun special attacks and the new animations, combat sounds and of course the UI are all satisfying and switching between powers, combos and characters is as smooth as can be.\n\nThe system can feel overwhelming at first to someone new to Persona as you are being given access to the full cast of P5 right from the start which is a lot of combos and a lot of persona powers to learn.\nOnce you figure it out non-boss enemies will very quickly fall into the \"one shot combo\" area which can make the game feel a bit repetitive and/or grindy; something P5 already suffered from but P5S is at least a lot faster to switch in and out of combat.\n\nHowever, while you will be facing several dozens of enemies at once quite early on leading to a lot of visual mess (albeit good looking mess), the game remains fairly forgiving and will let you get through a few levels with simple X and RT smashing while you figure out your combos.\n\nAfterwards, the game will nevertheless throw significantly more mini-bosses your way than P5 did which makes for more interesting combat; although the danger of those mini-bosses is damaged by the leniency of the game. Indeed, saving spots have become much more abundant than they were in P5 and without the time management component, the game encourages the player to jump in and out of the metaverse to get a complete free recharge of HP and SP before teleporting back to the save spot with no downsides whatsoever, making the game devoid of resource management if one makes use of this mechanic. \n\nMaster Arts are a new system in P5S which are awarded for directly playing a character. After playing a character for a sufficient amount of time additional combos are unlocked and that amount of time is arguably too little. However, it is an interesting mechanic to reward players for sticking to a character with some additional toys.\n\nFinally, the bosses. Transforming turn-based boss mechanics into hack and slash mechanics is no easy task and P5S does not really succeed at it...or maybe it chose not to and that's a good thing.\nBosses go through different moves and phases and the ideal strategy is often to learn their sequence of action, wait for the sequence to end, exploit their weakness, and blow your combos during their break between two sequences and repeat. This is in essence a turn-based system, except you get to press the dodge button to avoid damage during the boss' \"turn\".\nIt's however not a bad system, bosses in P5 were very enjoyable and they are just as enjoyable if not more in P5S. While they get away from the hack and slash fast paced power fantasy and fall more into a the calmer strategically turn-based realm of things, this change of pace in combat approach is most welcome and still manages to capitalise on some of the new aspects of the combat.\n\n\n[h1] A great sequel yet a questionable first release [/h1]\n\nOverall P5S is a great game for people who wanted straightforward easy fun with more of the P5 characters' personalities and interactions with some extra new gameplay ideas which all work well. \nHowever, with the removal of much of what made P5 such a unique and interesting adventure, P5S fails to exceed its predecessor, although it also does not feel like it is trying to and is content with being, in essence, a high-quality expansion.\nWhile newcomers to Persona or Persona 5 might be able to enjoy P5S as a standalone, the game is unquestionably a better experience by having played the original Persona 5 which makes the release of this game on steam before a potential Persona 5 Royal port questionable at best.\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5db4e971333e5a78af59d85e7a15f6a4", "author": "b7c73ba1b1405ccfb12c646d7efe9303", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1969, "content": "I've only played it for a bit, but I'm already in love with this game! it is an amazing game, and I hope that they also adds Persona 5 Royal to steam to!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8f416f9fe63653c5857c431520c32ee7", "author": "5782ab56a3bf5ce4a65f8f898117834b", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 3272, "content": "Story is a continuation of Persona 5.

If you plan to play this game and haven't played Persona 5 (Vanilla or Royal), this may give away some spoilers from them and you may lose context on certain things. \n\nGame is real fun. Combat is typical of Musou/Warriors games with the Persona style twist. The new characters are amazing. A several scenes alone (if you had played P5 prior) remind you why you loved Persona in the first place. \n\nOn the technical side of things. In the beginning of the game there are a few issues with audio. Mainly on the English dub end. Characters sound lower in several sections of dialogue. For example Yusuke, sounds lower than the rest of the group in the first few scenes of the game. I think that's due to the situation the English cast and crew were placed in mixing audio because of COVID\n\nSecond, some stuttering issues at 60fps on 3D cutscenes at times. I'm on windowed mode. Haven't checked at full screen and/or 30fps.\n\nThirdly, I have experienced I believe one or two crashes already. This was on windowed mode too. Luckily I wasn't too far from certain checkpoints so I didn't lose alot of progress.

(Like you can't check side missions in palaces, so you have to get out. You can't shop from anywhere else, but from the base even though you do shopping on your phone. And you can just leave and rejoin jails to regenerate without any penalties)\n-The jails (dungeons) are just a tad bit repetatives in it's objectives.\n\nThat's it.

is pretty decent. The RPG hack 'n slash feels much better than the turn based gameplay that the others have, which is the only reason I bought and played this. However after 20 hours of gameplay I feel like the fun is over, the story is good to an extent, go and rescue people from being brainwashed, yada yada. But that's the extent of the story and gameplay. \n\nI also feel like the everything revolves around the gameplay rather than story. Up to the third dungeon you are doing the same thing you have been doing for the previous two, maybe it's just me but going and getting [x] but you have to do [y] before being able to do [x] three times over seems monotonous and boring. There's nothing unique that changes in the dungeons that makes those aspects better, it's just the same gameplay loop and I personally got bored of doing the same thing to go onto the same thing again, but in a different area with different enemies. \n\nAs I stated previously with the game feeling like it revolves around doing the same thing to progress the story. It would've been better for me if to progress the story you wouldn't have to do the same thing you did in the last dungeon, but it was a bit different. Instead of go to three bird cages, fight mini boss, which then allows you to fight the actual boss, there could've been other ways to lead up to the final boss fight, such as puzzles, or do some task that isn't in the metaverse that unlocks a path to [x] that helps you get to the boss. \n\nThe gameplay however is good, being able to create persona's, you have bonds/ skill tree, different characters you can play as e.t.c, it's very fun. I enjoyed playing as much as I did, but after doing the same thing for the third time, it just felt repetitive and less engaging because you already knew what you had to do,  you already knew what was going to happen. But hey, maybe that's the whole point. I just didn't enjoy that aspect.\n\n---\n\nAfter being told that the game actually gets good after the third dungeon I decided that I would give the game one last shot and well finish it, I can say for sure that I was not disappointed. Albeit what I said previously and parts of that review still holding up, the game is spectacular. Gameplay does get better after the third dungeon and it is a great story driven game, apart from spending most of it with dialogue, cut-scenes, etc. But that might just be the point of a story game. \n\nSome things I wanted to address though is the frequent random crashes and the inconsistency between cut scenes.\n\nFirstly crashes, this game has crashed *a lot* for me and when I say a lot, I mean hoping for the best the game doesn't crash when you're on the last boss fight, all items used up, 2 team mates down and hoping it doesn't just seize up and tell you \"no\". I say this because it has happened to me at the end of boss fights where you finish a boss off, goes to a white screen, then the game crashes, very infuriating and needs fixing. \n\nSecondly, the cut scenes and dialogue are just inconsistent. I don't know why it's necessary for 3 types of ways to display something happening, you have the first way of just showing it via the just dialogue bars and the characters talking, you either have to progress by clicking or having it automatically do it, then there's it being rendered in the engine and an actual cut scene AND THEN there's it being an actual animation. What. The. F*&k. There are some parts in the game where it will progress in the order and it just doesn't make sense, just show me it in one way! \n\nBut those are just some nit-picks. Great game though and introduction to the series, at least for me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "52c37b96e92a50028c0a5e8603762ac8", "author": "50b1d3cd33d857be9e30e5cb7b38210d", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 2799, "content": "\u4e22\u6863\u4e86\uff0c\u592a\u6076\u5fc3\u4e86\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7764431987a25f599990d6db7205bd77", "author": "a70eb76da86b533aa26add0e20337d5a", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1410, "content": "p5\u672c\u7bc7\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u4e0a\u67b6\u554a\uff1f\u54c8\u538b\u5e93\u54c8\u538b\u5e93", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b6e6f09e6af7547fa59d5f3856c57e9e", "author": "bf978f25b7115f9184c87bdfac3f100a", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 5664, "content": "El juego es simplemente \u00e9pico y precioso, el combate es fluido, satisfactorio y curiosamente no se siente tan repetitivo(supongo que por la variedad de personajes) y y de lo que llevo de historia, todo excelente.\n\nAdemas, como port esta muy bien optimizado, tengo gr\u00e1ficos integrados (Intel HD 4600) y el juego corre bastante bien(con gr\u00e1ficos reducidos obviamente), la tasa de refresco es estable (juego a 30) y no he tenido ning\u00fan error ni nada.\n\nCompletamente recomendado.\n\nEdit(70 horas):\nTras completarlo y aqu\u00ed intentando sacar los logros y el NG+, la verdad es que se disfruta igual el juego, definitivamente mi \"spinoff\" favorito de la saga, ademas su historia esta bastante bien en comparaci\u00f3n a otras entregas(cof cof P3/P5 Dancing cof cof)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f1a7eed124c853a483961c7bce7e266a", "author": "cb14e4e458585d73b933164153fb00ce", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 707, "content": "buy if you liked p5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5cec20de744f53fb886fdd6c6ecf4758", "author": "460b57dd04825aae8f88b2b778537268", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 2991, "content": "Must play if you enjoyed Persona 5.\n\nThis PC version works flawlessly, instant load times, etc.\n\nMy only complains are how verbose the game is, you can be ten hours into the game and still see tutorial popups appearing, and also the difficulty balance, the first area seems way more difficult than the rest of the game.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c7efa2136a2b56fc8ff77ac577cba974", "author": "529d6bda0c285acabc6f3d8a5c64157c", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 3368, "content": "person", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ad0d5522d1925cda894929d293b27ff4", "author": "5a6989245f31578d99a633e0ebb7754c", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4261, "content": "Enjoyed Persona, still enjoying Persona 5 Royal, and now I am enjoying this game changing play style that makes the game very breath taking.

[h1] Hoooooo boy [/h1] Props to Omega-Force/Koei Tecmo, and P-Studio for making this game happened, and to Atlus for publishing this game to steam (praise be to Atlus). I will gladly buy any MegaTen related games.\n\nOkay so, I'll make this as concise as possible.\nThe story (although a direct continuation from the base game) is basically a reimagine of Persona 5's with a bunch of changes specifically for this spin-off. I'm just gonna say it follows the same structure, that's it (for those who have played, you'll know what I mean). It actually reminds me of the movie called HER because of how the plot heavily uses artificial intelligence as its main topic. Expect a lot of dialogue since this is still a persona game.\n\nThe gameplay is good no doubt about that, actually great. Who knew that a game that uses the combination between musou combat with persona mechanics would actually work wonders, I never thought it would be this good. Each character you control has different combat style and special ability. It's really the highlight of this spin-off.\n\nProbably the complains I have are the price and possibly, the end game content (I have my doubts on this one though) since when you finish the game, the only replayability value that this game will give you after finishing it are new game+ (you can totally 100% achievement in the 2nd playthrough) and a new difficulty. I really hope Atlus will update this game with new content, although it's unlikely to happen because this game was released in Japan a year ago and (to my knowledge) there had been no update since then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, as expected of Atlus. Even though they really milk this series hard, you can bet the spin offs of each game are done and polished really friggin well. A definite must have for those who enjoy both persona and musou combat type of games.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7de638ce31b4523c86cc3d161ddbdee9", "author": "23ae9413e60b5dc4bfd55e41657f80e2", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4331, "content": "Do cool things with cool friends without having to go outside to do cool things or meet cool friends", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7db04ee524245883854fb1456f698625", "author": "b2fd2272cbdf5b22aeb28c8b10e0b13e", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1217, "content": "Its an awesome 1v1000 game with fun and interesting with combocrafting aspects as well.\n\nFans of the Series will love the returning characters, and even being able to play some of the characters they know so well.

It's Showtime!\n\nBefore getting into the actual review, you should understand that this is a direct sequel to Persona 5 which is a Playstation exlusive title. \nIf you didnt play the original game or at read the manga or watched the horrible anime adaptation, you propably wont enjoy this game if you give any hsit about story. The game treats use as if you already know what happend, which is nice for people who actually do, but not for you if you have no clue whats going on. \nAlso, I think you will find it hard to care about the characters if youre not familiar with them already, since we spent over 100 hours getting to know them and their quriks, so a scene of them hanging out and having fun is propably pretty boring for somone who doesnt know them. Unless you are somone who just mashes the \"skip button\" as soon as text appears on the screen, go and play Persona 5 Royal first(improved version of P5)\n\nNow for the actual review:\nThis game is an absolute Banger. It really embodies the spirit of a sequel. The story is new and intresting while your previous knowledge is still helpful. The Dynasty Warrior gameplay combined with the Persona 5s unique style could have turned around really messy but they NAILED it! I have a lot of respect for creating a fun action RPG that still feels like Persona. You will still find yourself scrolling through your Persona skills to exploit your enemies weakness, All-out attacking and batton passing but now you can dash around and do cool combos and use your surroundings to your advantage. I think it goes wothout saying that all of this looks amazing, as expected for Persona 5. \nThere is a good mixture of new music that bangs just as hard as the first soundtrack and old tracks (remixed or not) that make the game sound familiar. \n\nThe game only crashed only once on me in 14 hours of gameplay, which really isnt a big deal. I cant imagine this game letting me down, thats why Im confident to write this review already, unless it isnt edited or deleted after I finished it, I stand by every word that I said :)\n\nGo out and steal some hearts!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8f82092bb4ef53cb8dc9c6deabf98743", "author": "fa676129bff9541f8a352bb955012ed2", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 2203, "content": "Until next time phantom thieves...", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8ffa3dfc17b254ad91bf98643dca8256", "author": "8b4a62d41fb55cfdab959c17be19b57d", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4135, "content": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19spin off\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e04\u0e27\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e07\u0e38\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e07\u0e34\u0e14\u0e21\u0e38\u0e21\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e01ddc7afc1d5e599919693d8da7f020", "author": "2831855109e2560083acbdb8ecd918df", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 5326, "content": "Super cool und spa\u00dfig.

Combat, although hectic at times, is never a chore and the story doesn't feel forced at all, everything flows perfectly! BUT if you are looking to play this game without prior experience in the Persona 5 universe i think it might become a bit confusing and little too much to handle, at the opening hours especially.

However, their are a few issues on PC that just are saddening. The Default controls are AWFUL. they're really bad, so I recommend using a controller, or changing them. I decided to play with a keyboard just to get the default experience. Their is a lack of multiple aspects from the original persona 5 that I wish were here, but this is a spin off game after all. The game plays well enough, their is a few minor odd things that happen (that may happen on console as well) but it isn't anything game breaking. The one thing that really makes me upset is when I alt tab, and go back into the game the dodge button (alt) will start making windows noises if you press it over and over again. (and you'll basically be using dodge alot). I hope to see more persona ports on steam! These games are great, and I'd love nothing more than to play them here, even if their are issues.

If you're into that, then you'll like this game. THOUGH, nothing on this page will tell you that. BUT as soon as I saw the Koie Tecmo logo followed by Omega Force, I got a sneaking suspicion this was a Dynasty Warriors game. THOUGH, as someone who's only played a handful of these and 3 of their off shoots (including this one), I kind of like this one the best. Yeah, you can button mash, but this and Hyrule Warriors was better at forcing other actions. I've played Persona 5 for a few seconds, but got SUPER bored with how story heavy it is, and how awful the story is, this has a bit too much for me. It's a neat and faithful melding of Persona and the DW formula. Visually this is the best Dynasty Warriors has ever looked. Clear that Sega/Atlus seem to be very protective of this property and were very hands on with it. \n\nIf you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona then this will definitely scratch that itch. I'll stick around for the battles, and just blow through the story, even though I know from previous attempts of getting into this series (P4 Golden) it means I'll probably get a bad ending, oh well. I'll look up an FAQ if the alternative endings are better or if it prolongs the GAME play.

Gameplay has no social sim aspect but the transition into action combat was really well done, higher difficulties alleviate the button mashing issue.\n\nI won't deny the story does feel like a rehash of the original Persona 5, but out of bias I'm fond of that familiarity, and some characters that did not get much of a spotlight in the main game such as Haru finally get a moment to shine here. You see way more group interactions in this game and I wish we had more of that in the original. The two new main characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, fit really nicely into the cast without altering the dynamic of the group that much.\n\nGameplay-wise I will admit it is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. The affinity and 1 More system from the series' turn-based combat was translated incredibly well into an action format, but it can still carry that notorious Musou stereotype of just mashing buttons in most normal encounters. For that reason I'd suggest playing on Hard for the best experience since it makes the benefit from exploiting affinities greater.\n\nAlso worth noting the entire social sim aspect from the main games is not here. It's pure dungeon crawling and platforming with the real world only really being used for story purposes and buying items. The Confidant system is replace by a secondary EXP bar named \"BOND\" that works as a sort of skill tree.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "520c05079b0b546a97af0d68ff90cf76", "author": "68a3a0ad1b055a3db6aced303f6c942d", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1610, "content": "llevo mucho tiempo esperando este juego y hasta el momento me encanta, es una maravilla", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "76d8acd9e31057a896c26cb251a78dff", "author": "edca8166bee35ad6bc0d0e1a6357e7d7", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4916, "content": "fun game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f9c2ab8a471e5e68b09cc1df4dd1ba7c", "author": "0debe91327775399ba5dde8c366c5341", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 7900, "content": "Great game.

Gameplay wise this feels like a love child between Persona 5, and Kingdom Hearts.    Many people try to compare it to a warrior game, but its battle type is much more like Kingdom Hearts,  yes there is tons of enemies but the RPG elements and interactions push it more toward the KH battle system.     Over all if I ignored the crashes  this is one of my favorite games.    However due to how often it crashes  even on a high end machine like mine.  I cannot possibly recommend this game to anyone.     There is 2 major crash types I have encountered,  First is the blackscreen.    This one happens when first booting up the game and in order to force it to close you have to open a new instance of windows and close it from there.    It usually only happens every other load.      Second crash happens during the course of gameplay and happens during loading screens which there is ALOT of.    There generally is alot in persona games but there felt like there was more in this one then previous.      Every 2-4 hours of gameplay you can expect to crash while transitioning between zones.     So if you do buy this game always save before you move from one zone to another in order to save frustration.        \n\nThat said,  the gameplay is over all pretty excellent the new way they handle bonding is interesting I liked using them as skill points.    And the persona point system is pretty grand too.   But the game is poorly optimized.\n\n\nEdit:   Just made it past Kyoto boss and it seems after the load screen it goes to infinite black screen as others have reported.

They\u2019re all amazing games that all fall within the same idea of combat, time management and Social links, but for some reason atlus decided to make this one a hack and slash. The combat feels mashy and brainless compared to what I would expect from a Persona/SMT game. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that it\u2019s a great game within its genre but the style of combat turned my immeasurable hype into disappointment. It just doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nEdit: \nI want to point out that when I wrote this review I had 1.5 hrs and the game had crashed once, regarding it as an anomaly.

I'm not sure why; to make things worse, the checkpoints to save the game are quite far in between so uhh, the anxiety of hoping the game won't crash while you're far away from a save point is stressful. So if you're playing, remember to save as many times as possible. Redoing what you did from the past 3 hours is not fun. \n\nAnyways, Persona 5 Strikers is a nice sequel for fans of Persona 5 (Royal). However, the combat is a musou-type game, being completely different from Persona 5's turn based combat. Although, it is very interesting to see how they incorporated hack and slash with the tactical use of personas & baton passes.\n\nThe overworld exploration is satisfying, being able to walk around Shibuya, Sapporo, Osaka, and so on with your pals is a nice feeling. \n\nOne thing to note is how the new Velvet Room functions. With the removal of social links, you can't get bonus exp for your personas from social links. Instead you can level up your personas through the use of PPs (Persona Points) which is a little disappointing but it's fine.\n\nTo further explain on the removal of social links, Persona 5 Strikers introduces a mechanic called Bonds to replace it. With bonds, you may unlock certain bonus perks like \"Extra Money Dropped Per Battle\" & so on. You can get bond points from playing through the game.\n\nIt's a game to play if you're interested to see what's up with the Phantom Friends after the first game. Not so for the depth of the combat/gameplay, Persona 5 (Royal) still triumphs on that part. \n\nSome mechanics from the first game were revamped or changed to be better/worse. It's up to you to make your own opinion on it.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "acf6078f7fd75408bd00571a02d450bd", "author": "59d66161e6175f948be2ff3f45b17633", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 7365, "content": "Where is izanagi?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 7, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c9dcb632e64455bb8f5d5d5ad9a43fbd", "author": "2693f4c86d305bba839344bc87817bde", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 1214, "content": "YES\nTHIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC\nThis is easily the best looking game in the entirety of the Persona franchise.

If you are a fan of Persona 5 and just wanted more of the characters and a good continuation of the story i think you'll find a game that you love right here!", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9e5d2eb0e3b559489d03d24d8e2201e4", "author": "c73875b40b745a378998473983ee32a9", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4160, "content": "Haru has an Arc and is cute", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c3e13267f065d61825225454cf47dc5", "author": "1bc2e7eb13475b4fa4ac6ff6171e7459", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4221, "content": "Damn, I can't believe it's over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a4ef6f8e89f15e84ba355e85759628e4", "author": "bd37c1a9055e50f59e283fb4d02180c8", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 4217, "content": "i really like this game it is kind of a like a continuation from persona 5. i have seen some people say you can play this game even if you did not play persona 5, but in personal opinion i would recommend against that as you most likely will not understand majority of the things they bring up about what has happened in the past aka Persona 5.  I was really happy to see this game out as i am a huge persona fan and have played person 4 golden and persona 5 royal and i was really sad to have beat the game and of the ending being a sorrow goodbye. This game is a lot like persona 5 but with the formatting of Fire emblem warriors or what others have said dynasty warriors. You can use your persona in this game but there is more hand combat rather then only using your persona or automated bullets like in persona 4 and 5. i love that you can also be the other characters and walk around aka yuskue and ana and etc, that is one of my favorite things as i am a huge fan of yusuke and i love being able to explore the jails as him and use him more!  I do really enjoy this game and got it the day it released but i will say there is a ton of glitches going on as the game tends to crash in times where you are unable to save and have to restart again. That can be a real pain in the butt especially when your grinding or in the middle of a movie scene. But i overall really enjoy this game and would recommend it to any persona fan and CAN NOT WAIT FOR PERSONA 6 TO COME OUT!

I had no previous experience with any Persona or Shin Megami Tensei media, but I believe this might change. Anyhow, the combat system is surprisingly very satisfying. Sure, it does not have the complexity of DMC5 or the absolute fluidity and smoothness of the original Bayonetta. However, it does not take away from the core hack and slash experience, in fact, the combo system reminds me a bit of how combos are handled in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance as you can, in theory, keep comboing endlessly, granted you don't get staggered, which, to me, is somewhat satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a 9/10 game for me.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d358d657b65c5f1089d05c5c095da4dd", "author": "8531460de9b651769106ee069866d821", "date": "2021-02-25", "hours": 2199, "content": "[b]Disclaimer:[/b] this isn't a full review of the game I'm currently on the first jail, so think of it as a first impression.\n\n[u]PROS:[/u] \n\n[list]\n[*] Great UI design and super vibrant presentation\n[*] Better Music than it's predecessor\n[*] The cast really felt like they matured from the events of the og P5\n[*] The battles feel like they go at a natural pace.\n[*] The story overall better pacing than P5 and is more engaging\n[*] Everything even remotely related to Sophie\n[*] It's nice to see that Atlus has come a far way from almost incomprehensible online lingo from Personas 3 (especially the Hermit s. link) & 4 to more modern online lingo used more sparingly, and for now it won't age the games dialogue\n[*] It's not Game over if Joker get's KO'ed\n[/list]\n\n[u]CONS:[/u]\n\n[list]\n[*] Horrible ridges on the modes at first (Can be fixed in settings so no biggie!)\n[*] Suffers from what newer Persona games, way too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, not brainless though, you will die\n[*] Gets a little repetitive but it's not painful since the story updates often and has near perfect pacing\n[/list]\n\n[u]TL;DR[/u]\nThis is a great game that deserves your attention; If your not super into to action and prefer the more methodical day-to-day life of the first one you probably should wait for a sale if you weren't to big on the story of the first one.But if you're iffy then give it a shot!

It does not contain any turn based combat which is a staple of the Persona series nor does it have social link (I assume it's because it takes place after P5, maybe it also assumes all links are maxed?). It's a sequel in terms of the story only. \n\nI would recommend this game if you're a big Persona 5 fan (like I am) otherwise I'd probably pass on it unless you're really into Dynasty Warrior type games. A lot of the references in game won't be understood by someone who has never played Persona 5. Also Persona 5 royal characters are not in this game so maybe that game isn't considered canon? \n\nIn terms of technical issues I haven't had any gamebreaking ones so far. I did have my game crash once during a loading scene after a big fight 5 hours into the game. I haven't experienced another crash since then. Just remember to save often because there is no auto-save so you could potentially lose hours of gameplay if it does crash on you. \n\nOne annoyance I have with the game is it forces you to exit the dungeons at the checkpoints to refill your hp/sp. It literally makes no sense to add that annoyance since it just adds on another 10s to watch the loading screen. The dungeons this time around are a lot more linear compared to the P5 and that may turn some ppl off. It was alright for me. \n\nI haven't finished the game yet and I'm still guessing who the antagonists are but so far I'd give the game a solid 7.5/10.\n\nedit: 40 hours and I finally finished the game, the story at the end becomes very predictable and pretty disappointing but the main issue I had with the game was still the random crashes which happened me right after the last boss fight which was a bit of a slog as you can imagine. It was a terrible feeling to have to redo the entire fight again even though I thought the design wasn't bad compared to other jrpg final bosses. It pulls the common jrpg trope I hate the most where it splits the party but this time around I felt it wasn't super imbalanced unless you basically never play your non-main party members. I can't recommend this game until they patch the crashing issues which they have refused to even acknowledge on their official forums.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bc89d5ecfa32577b967784d8761450a9", "author": "4f7de250b3b7594c8d05c10756e1ce5c", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1431, "content": "Mediocre gameplay but my spirits were crushed upon finding out characters swear in the game...\n\nheart wrenching :(", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 3, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8c041fed56145bc8b54999d617e37f73", "author": "126bdfff843754d58b670c3f22ba3a7d", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 4959, "content": "Absolute banger.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8fe262e2c98151ebbe320d675460cb23", "author": "1bf5c3f9956d54edb7ba46e677268ce0", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2880, "content": "HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO HEE HO", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "82cc16ad5bde5970a37d6abed00e30d4", "author": "a9e173c9ede3599bb474557d06cd3b17", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2447, "content": "Great action game but definitely pretty difficult for a beginner.

If you like where ff15 went you may like this same principle, i personally started out on ff1 for nintendo and hated 15 as most everything that made it feel like a rpg was gone for me. This feels the same. Its actually one of the few final fantasy i never did/wanted to finish. I get the feeling this will be the same unless it picks up.

The main bit is having to leave the jail, enter the rv, jail select, jail, every. single. time.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f242e5fe980c543e9b61181908f700bc", "author": "db62ff80771a5752a14721fa4ffcfb3d", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 6086, "content": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b Persona 5 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043d\u0430 PS3, \u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0442 Royal \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0435\u0451 \u0432 Steam. \u042f \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0430 Persona 5 Strikers... \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438 Persona 4 Golden - \u043e\u043a. \u041b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e Atlus \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442 Persona 5 Royal, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u0442-\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e... \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 P5S \u0432\u044b\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442 Persona 3 \u0438\u043b\u0438 Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne? \u0410 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0431\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u042f \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0439\u043c\u0443 \u0438\u0445 D:\n\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 Persona 5 - Strikers \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e 10 \u0438\u0437 10. \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440 \u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442... \u042f \u0441 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d PS2 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c (\u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0435 Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, \u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0419\u043e\u043a\u043e \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043e Drakengard, Fate/Extella \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435).\n\n\u0412\u044b \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 Persona 5? \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u0421 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b? \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0443-\u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 (:", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 9, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "57c8c969b6f45bf88177ca35bfc3ef78", "author": "d6d617cfa33a5561b71159b2fcccb7cc", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 6094, "content": "Spoiler Free!\n\n-Story: This is basically Persona 5-2. The story is a direct continuation of P5, and so if you haven't played the first one, you'll definitely be lost in this game. The writing quality is on par with if not better than the original. \n-Characters: There are some points where the original Phantom Thieves feel exaggerated, but for the most part they're very strong. Not nearly as flanderized as previous Persona spin offs. The new cast members are excellent additions. It's impressive that even with 10-ish characters, no one feels left out of the story. Also Haru got her screen time.\n-Gameplay: The combat is simple enough to get into, but has enough elements to make fights feel like more than just button mashing. Weaknesses, One Mores, Environment attacks, etc. all help keep you thinking about how to attack.\n\nAside from a few nitpicks here and there, I would say this game is excellent. Very fun combat and a great sequel story. The main limiting factor is if you haven't played P5. If you haven't played it, I wouldn't recommend this game. The combat is fun, but it's not enough to sell the game if you're not also interested in the story. Play P5 first so you'll understand these characters and what they're talking about when they mention past events.\n", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3425517505db54f8bb27a7473bbae045", "author": "4d69a6b708e958fc8680e13d2335330e", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 5538, "content": "Amazing, just Amazing", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9bbfea76b9de50338ef612669ce68883", "author": "76223b256f3d545f92b8bd697ffe600b", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1472, "content": "Hell yes.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7dfc5aa1de455ad7b522eda833ad2398", "author": "aa90602833165763a66fe2ecadd2ae33", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1640, "content": "*Enthusiastic Tweet*", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "94f8942cf71658098861abcc1521ebd1", "author": "8597d3381f5356dfb9439c8905c1108c", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2906, "content": "Excelente juego de la saga Persona.

However, the flair of Persona 5 remains, and it's very flashy, especially with the hack-and-slash gameplay. All-Out Attacks, Showtimes, and the series's signature \"persona eyes\" all add to this game's style, without the need for much graphical power, allowing this game to run on lower-end or older gaming PCs. Fair warning: the plot will not make a lot of sense without the context of Persona 5. As I do not have a PS4, I watched a let's play of the game instead (I am told the anime sucks). If you have a PS4, or are one of the lucky ones to get your hands on a PS5, I recommend you play Persona 5/P5R first, otherwise you won't have context. It is unfortunate that P5 or P5R are unavailable on Steam, but it is understandable if Atlus signed an exclusivity agreement with Sony.

In my opinion it is best played on the harder difficulty. That being said for some fans of the Persona series who played and loved P5 and Royal, this might be a bit disappointing. It feels like a slightly gutted version of P5 unfortunately.\n\nThere isn't really any sort of Social Link/Confidante mechanic. As such there's zero instance of the archana system for fusing Personas and the strategy behind it. There is also no real time constraints like in P5/R (which might be very welcome to a lot of people, I get it). For me, those were some of my favorite aspects of P5/R as it allowed you to really get to know the various stories of many great characters.\n\nThe game's story so far is enjoyable though, having taking place I think half a year after P5/R. There is no canon choice for things like romances, Royal's characters, etc. The style is still there and amazing as always in the new and changed environments and characters. The soundtrack is great like usual.\n\nAll this being said, even though I'm disappointed in some aspects of the game, it's still very enjoyable so far for the genre it's in. I don't usually care for Dynasty Warrior-type of games.

By far the best Persona spinoff we've had yet.\n\nThe fusion of Persona with Warrior style gameplay works great, the presentation genuinely makes you feel like you're playing a mainline title, except it's an Action RPG instead of a Turn-based one.\n\nThe story is very similar to Persona 5's, but with enough differences and additions to make it feel like a fresh experience. Definitely not as deep as some other Persona stories, but still a good one.\n\nI played on Hard difficulty, and battles rarely felt \"tedious\" or \"boring\" like a lot of people often accuse Warrior games of being (the only real exceptions being some optional bosses which act a little too much like HP sponges for my liking). I did find the difficulty jumped around a bit for certain bosses, where the boss of the semi-final dungeon was brutal to defeat, yet the final boss itself was a complete joke.\n\nThe music is, as you'd expect from a Persona game, absolutely fantastic. Lyn Inaizumi returns to sing for an almost entirely new soundtrack, as well as doing some Warrior's style \"Rock\" remixes of Persona 5 music (\"Last Surprise\" and \"Rivers in the Desert\").\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly stellar or anything, but they work well enough for what the game is going for (considering this games is also on the Switch). The art direction is as amazing a P5's was.\n\nApart from some HP sponge bosses and some occasionally crusty visuals, my only other complaint with this specific port is that I experienced quite a few crashes while playing. These usually occurred after long play sessions and weren't super often or anything, but still very annoying when they occurred and can potentially lose you a lot of unsaved progress.\n\nI'd also say I'd HEAVILY recommend playing the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this, as there's numerous characters and references to them that first time Persona fans wouldn't understand.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a solid 8/10. It's fantastic experience that Persona 5 fans will love, despite some difficulty and crashing issues. I hope we start seeing more Persona games being ported to other platforms now, specifically Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 FES (hopefully a remake for the latter!).", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e1dda8a4d02750d8b956dcf99f8d708e", "author": "b728931e9bb45361b5d78c0c7306fbb6", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1586, "content": "A Hideo Kojima Production", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cc6b36b823db54b1834168fe75b5a14e", "author": "19ba85cec62c5380acf3f24046f7ccbf", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1569, "content": "Purchased: 53 Euros (Voidu.com)\n\nIt's pretty simple, if you've played and enjoyed either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, I recommend this game.\nIf you have not played any of those, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game.\n\nThis game is for fans of the original who want more of the story. It's really a direct sequel to P5 rather than a standalone spin-off. The game takes place after the events of P5 and with the characters already having gone through a year of knowing each other, so it would feel more than a bit weird to be told 'welcome back' if its your first time there.\n\nBUYING IT NOW: So I ran into two problems that stuck out when playing. One was that the game crashed to desktop. It happened three times in the first 10 hours, but then never again, so theres maybe something buggy in the early locations? Or I got unlucky, either way, something to look out for early adopters. Second was that the game lagged quite a bit when multiple skills were used in quick succession, but by turning off ambient occlusion this problem seems to go away entirely and I got buttery smooth framerates.\n\nDELUXE EDITION: So I dont buy these normally, but I thought 'what the heck' for this one. So you get to play the game early (moot now), the 'all-out attack pack' which is just a bunch of starter items (little time saver but otherwise ignorable), and the legacy BGM pack (which I think is really worth it, one song from every prior persona game is included and the randomise function is customisable).\nTheres also the digital bonus content, which launches as a separate app from the game. The app itself is a little janky, but the soundtrack and art book are cool to have. Depending on how much you pay, might be worth it.\n\nBUT WHAT OF THE GAME ITSELF? \nIts a Dynasty Warriors style game. I have never finished a single Dynasty Warriors game but I liked this one from start to finish. The visual style of Persona 5 is carried over, along with a lot of the gameplay concepts. Yeah, now its a real time action game, but you still strike enemy weaknesses into baton passes into all out attacks. That part is still pretty satisfying. \n\nThe music is pretty great. Some pretty bombastic pieces to match the faster pace of the gameplay. \n\nWhen I finished Persona 5 and Royal got announced, there were 3 things I was hoping for. More Akechi, more Haru, and more hang out time with the gang. With Royal, I got more Akechi but I was still wanting for the other two. In this game theres more time with the phantom thieves and Haru gets some satisfying screentime. So Strikers essentially satisfies my desires. \n\nThe stakes definitely never felt as high as the original game, but its overall also a lot shorter than the original game. I finished the main story in 26 hours, but that might be an underestimate for the average. Theres still bonus bits to do in the game. Overall, its a fun add-on to Persona 5 that extends the story out further by one road trip.\n\nMaybe Persona 5 Royal will come to PC huh?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f5f8128c42ce508cb5b5849344ef03d3", "author": "3b65ff5e7545598c9468ab8bd7ff0ee1", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1193, "content": "Why are you reading this instead of playing the game?", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b2a90855c8ed559faf60bc42d5ab91ba", "author": "03b414d3b69d56dcb3274c58766d3dab", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1699, "content": "MUY BIEN ATLUS, cada vez te acercas mas, ahora en vez del persona 5 con subtitulo STRIKERS el que dice ROYAL.

I recommend not getting it if you're new to the Persona 5 story as the it takes place right after the main games and this won't be the \"authentic Persona experience\" if you're looking to get into the franchise.

And buy the SP recovery item every instant you can. \n- Go into jail then leave it let you reset the vendor items. So you can use this to stocking your Healing/SP Recovery Items. Cooking Ingredient also.\n- Combo let you use persona skills without spending SP. It's weaker but it'll save you alot of SP.\n- All teammate have their uses, But Sophia & Haru is highly recommend from how good they are. ( Just don't use Haru first boss ) \n\n\nThere're many downside for a console main game publisher/developer to be try out on PC, but i am truly welcome it. For i am a fan of Persona series for 10 years. Hoping for more Persona game to be release on PC.\nAfter 50 hours, i still want to play more and waiting for more things to unlock. It's a musou-like game, but is it felt like one? To be honest, no. I actually love the battle system more than vanilla P5. Despite being a fan of the combat system of Persona, it just hit me right to see your favorite characters combat in real time with flashy and REALLY EXTRA moves. I'm all about that extra moves.\nBut.\nThere're downside that i'm hope Atlus can fix and improve, i love the game, but it NEED TO BE IMPROVE.\n\n- Anti-alias is a joke.\n- Horrible basic keybinds. I change it the instant i am possible to. I don't blame them for how this is one of the first game they port to PC ( P4G don't have real time combat so the keybind don't affect this much and it quite alright. )\n- The game will crash from time to time, I crashed like 4 times in the past 4 days while in loading. Sometimes it could be truly horrible for how you're not saved after finish all request and going to the fight the Jail Boss. Cause we have to do it in one sitting. PLEASE FIX IT !\n\nI'll rate it for now, 7/10. If they can fix those that i said i would totally give it a solid 8-8.5/10\n\nPLEASE GIVE US DLC !

It plays in a Musou fashion where you smack and annihilate enemies in real time combat. It borrows the same concept as Persona 5 where you can use your skills in the midst of combat. Being in constant 60 FPS, the game runs smoothly and feels natural to the touch. The story and voice acting is as superb as usual and it doesn't stray far from the original Persona 5 despite being a different type of game.

You cannot talk to very many NPCs and the different locations serve just as backdrops.

However, I can't recommend this game because I just don't think it's very good on its own. I will probably play it to completion, but not because I think it's actually worth my time.\n\nThere's a scene early on where the old crew goes to the old hangout at their school and one comments about how it hasn't been that long, but they still feel a sense of nostalgia and I think that sentiment just about sums it up. I enjoy P5S only so much in that it reminds me of a game I rather enjoyed more and would likely have more fun replaying than honoring it in a sequel/spinnoff. P5S is weaker in just about every way. The story is rushed, the villains lack any depth, there is no buildup to the events that occur, and both dungeon crawling and combat have baffling design choices.\n\nKoei Techmo appear to have sort of mashed the Dynasty Warrior and Persona engines together, though one is custom and the other based on Unity. Combat plays like a DW game, but you are a team of four and enemies have the abilities and effects of Persona, at least for the most part, and theoretically this should work. One problem is that all the magic is range-based and so if you're attacked, it's usually from off-screen, and even weak enemies can have powerful effects. I spent an hour on one encounter because I had to fight alone and Pixies kept casting zio (lightning bolt) which caused stun and the duration was long enough for other enemies to punch me from full health to zero. I eventually learned that hit and run is the only way to survive.\n\nI am not a DW fan, but the combat just doesn't feel right in other ways, too. The camera is slow, controls sluggish, visuals to chaotic to be easily readable while being swarmed, you deal very little damage, and you're constantly switching between different characters with different control priorities and play styles. This could work if switching were seamless like Marvel vs Capcom, but it's not, or if each character was deep like and interesting enough for their own game like DMC5, which they aren't. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to say the combat is terrible, it's just not great. It's not a refinement of a good idea, nor a remarkable innovation. Okay, passable, not great.\n\nDungeon crawling is passable, functioning like in P5 with pseudo-stealth mechanics and platforming, though is mostly held back by long load times, even on my SSD. Whenever you find a checkpoint, you should leave the dungeon to heal up and immediately return and the only reason you won't is the loading screen on exit and reentry, even though each scene is fairly small and constantly reuses assets. This almost feels intentional because otherwise they could have made checkpoints heal you and you'd never have reason to leave the dungeon.\n\nFinally, the story: I won't go into what it's about too much because I routinely finding myself lose focus as dialogue flies by without developing much. The story is a thin wrapper around finding excuses to throw the team into dungeons and go on a road trip to find more dungeons. Learn that bad person exists, go to their dungeon, get blocked, defeat a mini boss, go back and defeat the real boss. Same formula as P5, just a lot more trimmed down. It also all takes place over a summer vacation road trip so you don't have any worries aside from someone being a bad person.\n\nVerdict: P5S is a toned down imitation of P5 that at times feels lovingly crafted, but mostly just a cynical cash grab made for fans and only fans.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0308622d51cf5d80b602afd3d9befb20", "author": "849052b3624c52aa9fe6dca921d326f8", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 4423, "content": "20 hours in and the game has crashed at least 8 times, and since there's no autosave and you often go for fairly long periods of time without saving, I have lost around 4 hours of playtime due to these crashes.

Sure, the combat is different from the original but I promise you, if anything, the change is nice. \nThis game still has an absolute bunch of story and cutscenes for you to enjoy, just like the original game. I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be very story driven and expected much more of a dynasty warrior style all the way through, I'm glad I was wrong on that one though. While I recommend playing/watching the original Persona 5, you can still play this game without knowing it, you'll just be a little confused or oblivious to some references.\nI'd say if you want just story, it's about 30-ish hours but to complete it (achievements, etc.) would be more like 50. Less content than in the original, but expected.\nThe new characters that are introduced fit the team perfectly and I really like how every single member has their own unique way of fighting, it's fun to change it up here and there. One of my favourite parts is that you can play as any of the cast (you'll always be Akiren/Joker for the social stuff and for main story, though) and they all have their own unique animations and cutscenes, it's just a whole lot of fun all the way through.\nI am the same as everyone else hoping that Atlas decide to port P5/P5R to steam, but for now, this is a really nice way to scratch the itch for Persona players and fans alike.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id":

The music, I absolutely enjoyed the new tracks, even with the original Persona 5 sound tack made it feel so nostalgic, even adding past games was also nice to randomize the tracks for every battle you get into.

For any newcomers on Steam looking to enter the Persona series, I do not recommend this game as an entry point. The game assumes that you've played Persona 5 and understand the group's dynamics and past because it does not explain it to you and constantly references the OG Persona 5 game. So this is a review of Strikers from a fan of Persona 5 instead of a newcomer.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe Phantom Thieves goes on a trip around Japan! Strikers does a great job in giving the player more group interactions and is also an excellent tourism advertisement for Japan. Not much to say here without spoiling the story, but any Persona fan who wants to see more Phantom Thieves will get their money's worth.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the part you're probably looking for. The collaboration between Omega Force and P-Studio brings the Warriors gameplay to Strikers. However, unlike Hyrule Warriors, this game does not utilize the same overall gameplay as the Warriors series. You will not be going around a big map fighting generals with your army. Instead, Strikers plays [b] exactly [/b] like Persona 5, but it's now an Action RPG. You navigate the map similar to Persona 5, slowly approaching enemies to ambush them. Using Personas, you target weakness to down your enemies and execute an All-Out Attack. Show Time also makes its return from Royal. This core gameplay loop will be familiar but now it's cooler and more fast-paced because it has action elements in it. If you love the gameplay in Persona 5, you won't have a problem here.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nBecause it's an Action game now, the Strikers remixes have more electric guitars in it and sounds 10x more energetic. It's amazing. I'm listening to it on repeat already. If you love the Persona 5 OST, you can add the new songs into your playlist and jam out even more.\n\n[h1] PC Port [/h1]\nThe PC port is pretty average. Nothing significant to note of its settings; it's the same settings you expect from a typical PC game. The game also caps at 60fps, so no unlimited/120/144 fps. One important thing to note is that this game does experience some random crashes when loading a new area/going into another menu, based on mine and my friends' experiences. Save often to ensure you don't lose much progress when one does eventually happen.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is definitely a game you will want to play as a Persona 5 fan. By no means is this some insignificant spin-off, it's a sequel that Persona fans will want to play like how Royal is. I'm happy that Atlus (probably with help from KT and Omega Force) decided to put this game on PC and I hope that it's a continuous sign of more Persona games coming to PC. Also, after finishing this game, if this game gave ideas to P-Studio to make future games as Action RPGs, I'm [b] all for it [/b].

I just...wow.\n\nLet me be clear.  I [B]DESPISE[/B] Persona 5.  As a huge fan of Persona 3 and a \"meh\" fan of Persona 4, Persona 5 felt like a straight up slap in the face, doing everything in its power to irritate the player.  Cats forcing you to go to bed, a bunch of time management worse than your day job, less-than-memorable cast (this is mostly due to the padding which was another issue), etc.  Royal comes along - I skipped it due to censorship (yes, it's censorship).\n\nI was on the fence with this.  But I watched someone play briefly and was intrigued that it seemed to better respect the player's time than Persona 5.  What I didn't expect was to walk away feeling so energized from the experience, start to finish (mostly).\n\n[h1]What I Liked[/h1]\n\n\u2705 It's not going to win graphics awards, but it's good for what it is, and (with the exception of transition screens) runs at 60fps.\n\n\u2705 It's a [B]MUSOU[/B] game.  Some will say \"no it isn't!\" - because they don't understand the true intent of a Musou game. It's to clear out enemies.  That's all you do here.  No school, no chores at home, etc.  Just clearing out enemies and doing events to unlock the next area.  The thing is, Omega Force did an AMAZING job with the skin this time to basically make a \"role playing Musou\" game.  That's what this is, and it's pulled off so well I was shocked.  The characters in P5 \"felt\" like they should be in a fast-paced action game rather than a turn-based slog, and here we are.  It just feels like a perfect fit; battles are fast and furious once you master the various mechanics.\n\n\u2705 You can use all of the previous (non-Royal) characters.  There are also two new ones you meet along the way.   Each has a different and unique play style, from melee to Persona spells to even guns (slingshot, for Mona).  This lets you basically create your own fun, choose your characters, and have at it.\n\n\u2705 Absolutely NO padding.  None.  There's nothing to sidetrack the story and nothing to distract from the storyline (which is a sequel...more like an epilogue...to P5).  The result is, you're looking at 30 hours if you rush.  Which is actually a very good length for a game of this style.\n\n\u2705 Pacing is near perfect, as things progress when you want them to, and you're given plenty of warnings when things are going to be missable.  It never feels like a slog.  Also, despite the fact this is essentially a road trip, you'll not be seeing irrelevant nonsense like Final Fantasy XV, so even there it's got it down pat.\n\n\u2705 Challenge is decent without being ridiculous (see below for a note though).  Here's where they do Musou right: enemies will actually make an attempt to kill you, but it's usually the larger enemies that are hiding partially behind the mobs. \n\n\u2705 The last boss and final sequence requires a bit of belief suspension, but given this is Persona, I'm willing to give it a pass.\n\n[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]\n\n\u274c It is true that you should AT LEAST watch a \"Let's Play\" or read a synopsis or something before playing this, because it throws you right into the action.  There should have been a recap cutscene at the beginning.\n\n\u274c I'm not a fan of some of the sidequests/Requests, because they fall into the \"Dragon Quest IX\" pitfall.  For those that don't remember that terrible game, it would have a quest that says \" kill three Wolves\".  You're like, easy work....but then it's like \"ahhhh, but wait...you must use this technique that fails 95% of the time to  stun them.  Oh and they only come out at night.  Good luck!!\"  In other words, BS requirements.  There's a number of those, mostly from the Velvet Room (make this Persona with this spell where you have navigate through a clunky UI to even find it).\n\n\u274c It will intermittently crash.  It seems to be very memory picky, because every time I experienced a crash it was when memory was challenged (due to other things running).\n\n\u274c There are a lot of places that have a prompt (sign, whatever), where you can't actually ever go there.  I can't stand when games do that.\n\n\u274cThe AI tends to be a bit stupid sometimes.  More often than not, I'd look over and see two out of three of them dead for no clear reason (Mona should heal, but doesn't consistently).\n\n\u274c Some of the Jails are a bit irritating to navigate simply because they require you to do a lot of backtracking for switches or whatever, which I also can't stand.\n\nI say these things but I'm serious when I say, this is SUPERIOR to Persona 5 or Royal.  From a presentation perspective, you expect the Thieves to really be in an action game, and that's what this is.  But it's also a role-playing game.  Don't overlook it because it's got Musou applications.  If you enjoy role-playing games with some action, this is worth your time and money.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "29e06742e68b522e90d3544f094a9b3e", "author": "30ca633e3b3e5b9a954472fb199f0b58", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 927, "content": "To start off let me get my thoughts on the game out, this game is great. It's not amazing, but it is great. I am not a fan of the dynasty warriors type of game play usually, however this game re-imagines that concept with the different characters and abilities in a way similar to Hyrule Warriors. The story and characters are just as lovable as they are in Persona 5. A small issue that many people have with this game is the lack of social links and confidants seen in previous entries in the series, but this game makes up for it in its fast game play. This game is not the same game as Persona 5, it's its own game. The fact that you can exit and re-enter the jail to fully replenish your health and sp on the same day without being forced to sleep is a great part of this game and the jails are absolutely massive.

Even if it's on Easy so you can random-button-mash the combat, it's worth it just for the story alone! This is a direct sequel to the original Persona 5 (not the Royal expansion), and it takes place a year later. The music, as usual, is fantastic from the moment it starts, and jumping back into this world feels like reuniting with an old friend! \n\nI'm an avid mouse & keyboard gamer but I would definitely recommend connecting a controller for this game. I used a PS4 controller and it was extremely easy and streamlined, just plug it into the computer with a micro USB cable and you're ready! The game switches seamlessly between mouse/keyboard and controller input & display depending on the last input it detects.\n\n60fps Persona is a dream; this and the P4G PC release are both proof that this game series deserves simultaneous PC releases from here on. One downside right now (as of 2/23/21 at 10:52PM) is I've had a handful of crashes, usually on loading screens.

You will struggle with this game if you button mash, which I like. It \nmakes you learn when to use certain skills and when to use just the character's base attacks.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReplay Value: Great replay value for 100% completionist and people who want to do Merciless Difficulty. (i'm doing that rn and it's really fun so far! Just make sure you prepare for it before going in.)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPost-Game: Persona 5 Strikers can offer around 5-10 hours of post game content before NG+ is unlocked, and I actually really like it, it gave me something to do even after you beat the Final Boss. The post game can challenge your skills with the game so far and really put you up to test with some of the content they give you during post-game.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPC Port: This PC port is not great at all, through out my 55+ hours of this game, the game crashed many times and even set me back 3 hours one time. It could've been much much worse, but could've been so much better. I think Atlus should work on this field alot more in upcoming PC Ports of their games.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion: Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to Persona 5 and continues great story telling even if feeling slow at times with some pacing issues in the Jails. It also offer a lot after you beat the game like, a new difficulty, Merciless, a Post-Game that keeps you playing and improving your abilities, and overall is a great experience for those who have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. (Atlus port these please)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScore: 8.5/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "920c1fe3754f51f4af3649baa2cec336", "author": "f972c347bb5051e1b54df963da7632d3", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2435, "content": "p5r gkd", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e171da6b062254a8bb491363997dd2dc", "author": "81d1277767395dfe84888dd7143301a2", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 213, "content": "Only 2 hours and its fully sucked me in just like persona 5/royal.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c7a1da933fd51409c27dc4d330d4854", "author": "90654c6ec693517ba4f8192e3d5b6553", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2023, "content": "fun 2", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "086a6552c0695a35afa2fba2de842c94", "author": "6c4c12c5f444559fa9f4aef9dca670b7", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1887, "content": "Dear GabeN, i would like to beg to you: please convince Atlus to bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam, because it is rumored that P5R will only be exclusive to Epic Games.

is a pile of trash that attempts to cash in on the Persona branding while ignoring pretty much everything that made Persona 5 what it is. \n\nAllow me to explain. Strikers has a very strange sense of 'balance', where most random encounters can be solved in a single hit by ambushing the enemy and immediately going into an all-out attack that just clears the screen. About the only time you'll ever get hit is if you don't pull off an ambush - which is common because the \"ambush\" button is the same as the \"power attack\" button and so half the time you'll wind up shooting the enemy instead of ambushing. You also more or less lose the ability to ambush enemies from behind: you pretty much have to be in a hiding spot and the range from which you can ambush enemies from a hiding spot is greatly reduced from what it is in Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nThen you have the boss fights, in which all sense of balance goes out the window. Most bosses can and will kill your party in one or two hits even if you're the appropriate level to be fighting them, and the party member AI is simply not equipped to deal with them. For me, most of the boss fights consisted of having my entire party die immediately followed by me taking control of whoever was left and alternating between mashing the dodge button and getting in one or two physical attacks before repeating the process.\n\nGone is the ability to creatively use spells or Persona fusion to address the difficulty: spells cost several times what they do in Persona 5 and your party members have less than a quarter of the SP they normally would have. The idea is that you're supposed to do attack chains that end in your Persona casting a weaker version of a spell for free.. except there's no easy way to control which spell it casts if it has more than one. I believe it's based on the number of times you hit the light attack button before hitting special attack, but it seems random to me.\n\nFusion is also significantly nerfed - there are fewer Personas in the game and a lot of them have been nerfed to the ground from P5 or Royal. There's no opportunity to get creative with fusion the way there is in the real game, where you can make a Persona specifically to address certain situations.. meaning that there will be situations where you simply do not have an answer to what the game is presenting you with. \n\nThe game tries to address this by giving you frequent save points, from which you can go through multiple loading screens to recover your HP and SP by leaving for the real world from the dungeon and then coming back.. instead of having, I dunno, a button that you can just press at the save point. Considering that you can use maybe three heals on a full SP bar (and each one heals maybe a third of your HP) this means you'll be seeing load screens a lot.\n\nThen there's the frequent issues linked to this game's poor implementation of Denuvo: random crashes, hanging on loading screens, slowdowns and frame lag. \n\nGive this one a pass until it's on deep discount.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "708b94ab92d1539ea52fa8ef2e04472c", "author": "f7adf3746c325805acd4a9a4755a2ced", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2088, "content": "Good game however i would recommend at least having at least some understanding of the original persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b2dd3e7b36d75eb7b4a603858d384c21", "author": "8f6b5b022ba25911a411d686c7d1a686", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 7071, "content": "Simplesmente perfeito", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dad875b217e75f9a9307d59ce7ec3931", "author": "dd02590b8a915ac2ae460b53e83825ff", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 111, "content": "where is Kawamommy AKA best waifu :(", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "78c2c0f78500545486cedde88992b17b", "author": "47b84e7fabff5dfc89f9aa6dd2f56451", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 2771, "content": "It's a Persona 5 game.\n10/10 no brainer", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3637f033c0295f97a2936dadc427b2f5", "author": "a239927806dd57658a7c4537d475f198", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 29, "content": "I admit I should have looked more into the game instead of just be blinded by \"Persona\"...but this game isn't like any of the others, for me, not in the good way at least.

While it may look like a simple Dynasty Warriors clone with a Persona skin, the reality is that this game has a LOT of depth behind it.\n\nThe action-based combat retains a lot of the systems at play in P5 and P5R - elemental weaknesses, technical attacks, status moves, buffing and debuffing, 1-More attacks, All Out Attacks, Baton Passes - you name it and Strikers has most likely implemented it in some fashion. In addition to the core systems, each character feels fantastic to play - each boasting unique movesets, abilities and progression paths, as well as displaying a lot of their personality in their fighting style. To put it simply, there's a lot more to the combat than meets the eye, and those who have previously played the original Persona 5 or Royal will appreciate the small details here.\n\nThe story so far (around 16 hours in) feels very lively thanks to the strong returning cast of characters as well as the two great new additions, Sophia and Zenkichi. The English version brings more fantastic performances which give the game a unique charm, and while the stakes don't feel too high at the moment, the relationships these characters have with each other make each moment feel endearing.\n\nThe music, my god the music. Straight up bangers everywhere. Do yourself a favour and listen to one of the new battle themes, Daredevil. If that doesn't get you excited to beat up some demons, I don't know what will.\n\nA caveat I will mention and the one gripe I have with the game do far is that ultimately it is a sequel, meaning it's difficult to recommend to new players who didn't experience the original game. You could probably enjoy Strikers by reading a synopsis of P5's plot and characters, but really you would just be doing yourself a disservice. As great as I've found Strikers as a massive fan of its predecessor, the lack of a PC port of the original makes it a very hard sell.\n\nIf you're willing to look past that, or you've already a fan who has played P5 / P5R, you will most likely fall in love with the Phantom Thieves all over again in Strikers.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c460685922a45af8bdc1dcd89ea46535", "author": "72b0777948255156b81282994bdd81d4", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1278, "content": "Juegazo, toda la esencia Persona 5 con un estilo diferente de combate.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0012df6295905354a5639214d97c095e", "author": "9b26a963bc3556ffb243cfac9e61475a", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 3324, "content": "yep it's definitely a persona game", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "50de198632a55c1c829ab9fdc6479dac", "author": "c6599d7989b75157b9f12f913f23493c", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 5362, "content": "esquishito", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6e1c672a0c985a688c5faf565fb541f5", "author": "dac4c0ba396b58a0b2a24445a65758ed", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 5185, "content": "yes", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f605e2b6f41e5ed285c4f3648d80a4f6", "author": "47e728d231035597860ec5b3dfaaea99", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 1950, "content": "Really fun game!

This combat, while it does take a while to master, is extremely addicting and is the highlight of the game so far for me. The story is entertaining as well, and travelling across a bunch of cities with the gang is a vibe. As this is the first game in the P5 universe on steam, playing it just really makes me want Persona 5 Royal on steam that much more.

Atlus released a new Persona game on PC? And it's day in date with PS4?! What is this madness?!\n\nBut it's true. If the message to Playstation fanboys didn't come through that Atlus PC ports are here to stay, this does now. This is now Atlus' second PC port they've done themselves fresh off of Persona 4 Golden (which they did a fantastic job on and you should go buy and play that game now. Do it.) Now Koei Tecmo did codevelop the game, but the good news is they had no part in the port at all. It was all Atlus. KT only made the combat mechanics, while Atlus made the rest of the game.\n\nSo how does the port fair? THEY MANAGED TO MAKE A PC PORT BETTER THAN P4G, in such a short amount of time too! Atlus is a newcomer to the modern world of PC gaming, and they're already making ports like seasoned vets. Everything is fast, smooth, and fluid, and runs amazingly. If the port for Strikers is this good, then the eventual port of Persona 5 Royal will be even better. (Seriously Atlus, get on that.)\n\nSo, what is Persona 5 Strikers? Well, it is the sequel to Persona 5, only instead of a lifesim turn based JRPG, it's a musou, but don't let that discourage you. It's a musou designed for people who don't like musous, like me. It plays less like the traditional Warriors games and plays more like a Persona game that's real time action instead. And man they nail the power fantasy. You feel like a slick badass as you slice and dice through massive hordes as your favorite Phantom Thieves. One thing to note: If you're expecting the social life and RPG mechanics the Persona series is known for, you're gonna be sorely disappointed. Strikers is action and action only. Don't let that discourage you from buying it, because when going through the massive levels it plays like a big action oriented Persona game. That's not a complaint, it's a warning.\n\nStorywise, it's really big for what is on paper just a musou spinoff of Persona. The game is a sequel taking place six months after the events of vanilla Persona 5 (so storybeats from Royal will not be present. However the playable Phantom Thieves from Royal will be making an appearance as DLC later in the year.) It is summer vacation and a new threat emerges as wicked evil people are mind controlling people by stealing their desires, and it's up to you to beat them up and all their endless hordes. If you haven't played Persona 5 yet, do so before playing, otherwise you're gonna get spoiled hard, as well as lost on what is happening.\n\nBut that brings me to my biggest complaint of the game, and it's not the game itself, but the release. The Persona series finally broke free from Playstation exclusivity, and everyone is hype off the heels of Persona 4 Golden wondering what's next? Would Persona 5 come next? That's a logical move since Persona 5 is the hot new game everyone's raving about. Well instead, the game we got was the sequel to Persona 5. People really want Persona 5 Royal and have been begging for years to come to other platforms especially PC so we don't have to emulate vanilla P5 through RPCS3 anymore and could support the devs. But instead we got this game, a game that probably won't sell well on PC since we don't have the first game to go off of. My only guess to this is SEGA wanted Strikers to get a PC release first since it was coming out next, and they're basically playing catchup. But man, does it sting STILL not having Persona 5 especially since they know we want it after they made that press release about the emulator C&D. All I can hope is that Royal gets a PC port announced soon, similar to the missing Yakuza games getting announced for PC a month after Like a Dragon released. We need Royal on PC ASAP, especially for this game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d9095122a5335827a90a95569b6c61f0", "author": "8fd8ded5f8ff5a2a83c87035c76eca94", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3387, "content": "Fun and inoovative musou styled game.

The story is definitely getting more interesting at this point.\n\nUpdate (13 hours in): The story is picking up now and the enemies are getting tougher. It's ramping up like a typical Persona game.\n\nReview in progress: \n\nAs a Persona fan, I can tell you this truly FEELS like a Persona game. \n\nThat means you get the best and worst of Persona in every form. I'm about 7 hours into Strikers, and the pacing is incredibly slow, just like Persona 5. This game mirrors Persona in the sense that it really doesn't respect your time, but it also mirrors it in having an interesting story, fun new characters that expand the Persona lore, and all of the usual hijinks you expect from the series. \n\nThe gameplay here is very novel and repetitive. They've adapted pretty much all Persona mechanics to a third person action game format, and that's rad. You get to play with the whole cast and level up their abilities. If you find the style of game fun, you'll have a great time. If you get easily bored of beating up large groups of mostly weak enemies, you'll probably get bored of Strikers. \n\nSo far, I feel like I can recommend this to Persona fans. There are some crashing and black screen issues, but you can work around them. \n\nP.S. it's still really cringy how sexualized some of the characters are, just like in every Persona game.

I enjoyed P5R, but I felt it leaned a little too heavily into fan service, and as a result wasn't as good as just regular Persona 5 (that and I'm still mad about how broken Okumura was in that game, but that's a different story.) This game though - I might actually like it more than Persona 5. The combat is fast paced and intense, where you're swapping between characters rapidly for follow up attacks, hitting weaknesses, and using environmental objects to beat down shadows. I never thought I'd get to play as a cat wearing a bandit mask on a skateboard running over Jack Frost, but here we are.\n\nThe social aspect of this game is definitely [i]different[/i] than in Persona 5, though I wouldn't say it's worse. It's a lot more based on exploring cities for cool moments with your team and building the team skills you want out of the social points you earn for spending time with them. The time system is also very different than in P5. Though the calendar still progresses, it moves with set story points rather than each time you leave a palace or spend time with a friend. Again, this isn't [i]worse[/i] than P5, it's just different. Strikers is trying to put a pretty decently sized game into one summer vacation, so they only have what, six weeks to tell their story? I think it took me more than six weeks to get my first confidants to max rank in P5, so I have to admit that this system works a lot better for this setup.\n\nThe real highlight for me so far though is honestly the characters. Persona 5 had some great villains, but most of them were irredeemably awful people, end of story. This game though is willing to tread into grey area a lot more willingly. You're going to face off against objectively bad people - but you'll also see why they became this way, how they're real people tumbling down slippery slopes of mistakes and bad decisions.  Without getting too much into spoiler territory, the two bosses I've gone against so far have had a lot more dimension than the earlier bosses of P5. This entire tangent is also ignoring the new NPCs who are on your side. I've found these characters to be quirky, interesting, and willing to add some life and spirit to an already vibrant group. Even the Phantom Thieves' dynamic feels a little more polished than in P5; The team, while still up to their usual antics, are calling out great kills by specific members, appreciating even Ryuii's accomplishments. I know, people not making fun of Ryujii. Who'd have thought we'd see the day?\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is a mix of funky new jams and the original P5 soundtrack on steroids. What's not to love?\n\nTL;DR: A sequel has a lot to live up to, especially if it's changing genres, and this absolutely exceeded my expectations.  I paid 10 extra dollars to play this game four days early and absolutely regret nothing.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c6dde0e111e95c719534bc34e18cf637", "author": "1a2d5ea42c3d5a288f9de692fb7b3f61", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5795, "content": "Makoto", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f78304940115824a2d5458adea1c0ef", "author": "f73b19bd0ead565d8dd457c3c14c9745", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 659, "content": "N I C E.\n\nBring P3FES and P5R to steam and I swear I will buy them again.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "6f200e40dc25552d97f36a2137934757", "author": "b1c7da0ac3bb5a8681804fe3c69d6630", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1627, "content": "it's like persona 5 lite mixed with final fantasy 15.

Having about a couple of hours of grinding and stuff the game is exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Taking 6/7 months after the events of Persona 5, the Phantom Thieves are back in action! The gameplay is a mix of the general warriors style combo (2-6 light attacks followed by 1 or 2 strong) mixed with persona elements. Such as certain Combos like (2 light - 2 Heavy) casting a persona's skill. However if you are looking for more Hyrule Warriors / Dynasty Warrior game this might not be for you. Strikers is more Persona than Warrior. The RPG elements shine through with the different personas, cutscenes, and story. In reality if you changed to combat to be turn based again it would be almost a lightened version of the original, which isn't bad. It's really nice and the two styles of game blends well. If you like Persona 5 and want more story and willing to learn the combos and controls, I recommend it. If you like Warrior style games and want more of a JRPG elements, I would as well. \n\nFor instance, with most warriors games it's action, pick a level action, while with Strikers it's more here a  bunch of story, motives, and planning followed by encounters. The encounters are like standard JRPG run into an enemy and the fights start. The tutorial itself, took about 5 / 6 hours to get to the point of listening to all conversations talking with team-mates every day (Which can give items). \n\nI'd recommend this game in a heartbeat for anyone wanting more persona or a warrior style RPG. I never got around to finishing Persona 5 and watched a quick 3 minute lore video on Youtube.

Joker, Panther, Haru, Morgana, Fox, Queen, Jail Bait who is still unplayable, and the newly added Jail Bait v.2 The game is flashy and STYLISH in the typical persona fasion except brought to us in the form of a musou game. So you can hack slash bomb and punch your way to the new world without having to press X to guard the next attack. It mixes up the typical musou formula by adding elements that were present in p5 and takes on a truly unique spin to what a musou fan would be used to. What more could a fan want? This is the team we know, This is the team we love.\n\nWell...\n\nI cannot recommend this game to either a persona fan or a musou fan, If you are coming from a game like DW or WO where you get 50+ unique characters with different personalities, unique skills, unique weapons, and unique abilities to attach to those weapons you are going to be left wanting because here all you get is about 6 characters with unique personalities, Personas (skills) and Weapons. They have shrunk the formula here and made things much simpler in order to appease the original fan base (presumably, there is no document stating that) which failed in my opinion. Reason it failed is because the original fan base is still left wanting as well. There was so much potential to introduce new phantom thieves with this \"sequel\" The Doctor, The GunShop owner, The Teacher, Lavenza (who is actually 2 people)  all of them could have been included or added later and present a unique set of weapons and game play elements. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive which is typical for a musou, HOWEVER, usually you get bored try a new character from a roster of 50+ people and here you get to get bored and try a new character about 6 times, if you get bored beyond that you are SOL so you better REALLY enjoy a particular move set. \n\nHonestly...\n\nI could go on but that's about the gist of it. They tried to merge two different worlds and ending failing both of them. Which is sad cause i really do love these phantom thieves.\n\nThanks & Good Luck\n\n", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d17ba9824a095eef926874f578f3380d", "author": "1bdf2bef204f55c8b231d5d064f98618", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 275, "content": "\u042f \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ad764d9a108d5b579b2e05a96fb82c99", "author": "94b4f7412cbc5e86b092eab0d144c799", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2402, "content": "gud", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9854a828e5135af484a8eb55c73b1412", "author": "5938102ccf0553129e1916bce07fc7b0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2120, "content": "\u725b\u903c\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "234b24f8c20258bb8e891d6b380832f0", "author": "b508d1afcd565d90af5e1bcb2d059b5b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4619, "content": "HEEHOO\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2870\u280a\u2801\u28a2\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2814\u2808\u2810\u2884\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u28a0\u28fe\u28ff\u28e6\u28a3\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u280e\u28f4\u28ff\u28f7\u284c\u2844\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28a3\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u285c\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ef\u28d1\u28c4\u28f0\u28ea\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2819\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2840\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u2844\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28f0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u2836\u2824\u2834\u2836\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\n\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281b\u2809\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2808\u2809\u283b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2840\n\u2800\u2800\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2819\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e0\u28f6\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28f4\u28e6\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bf\u28ff\u281f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u28bf\u28ff\u2807\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2818\u28bb\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u284f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800     \u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u28a0\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u28f8\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u280f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28f7\n\u28b8\u28ff\u281f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2819\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u2844\n\u2818\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u281b\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u281b\u280b\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800  \u2819\u2803", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4297ba4e72fa5c798ba06030a3e0d4d7", "author": "65aa79dba8005d918f7545633857ee5a", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 7426, "content": "If you liked the persona 5 jrpg you're gonna like this game most likely. The gameplay and the mechanics are pretty tight and i didn't feel bored at any point except for when the game crashed on me but i played it from day one (or day -4 actually) on fairly old hardware and atlus and project omega are working on the game to rid it of bugs. On the story side it's not as good as was persona 5's but it's still alright, the comedic moments are still as well written as ever and the characters are ok. I didn't have as big a connexion with the new thieves as with the original ones for the obvious reasonthat they are exclusive to this game but they get a fair bit of character development and were still pretty endearing. The villains were a bit more basic this time around but still did the job right. This game really feels like you're going on a roadtrip with your fellow Phantom Thieves and i often found myself enjoying the dialogs and thinking what i was gonna cook for the group (even tho it has no actual implication further from getting healing items). The story is a bit predictable wich is a bit sad though i didn't mind it too much as i was too engrossed in this summer vacation with the team. On the music side i didn't verify if it was just my deluxe version but i had access to the fight musics from persona 1-4 and remixed versions of base p5 music. The original music is of course amazing and i did like the remixes tho i personally preffer the jazzy feel of the original p5 music instead of this more rock version. If you have played and liked persona 5 it's worth buying and playing this game and if not this gameis still more than ok but you'll miss the refferences from quite a few jokes and you won't get everything from the story as some things are only explained in the jrpg like the story of the phantom thieves for the most part plus you won't have as deep a connection with the characters. I would reccommend playing p5 or p5r before playing this game for full enjoyment. p5 is less expensive and is accessible on ps3 at the cost of graphics and on ps4 and p5r is only accessible on ps4(i don't remember if the ps5 has backwards compatibility). if your budget is tight i would still reccommendplaying p5 first if you like jrpgs as it is absolutely excellent and if you don't want to play it or don't own a ps3/4 then you might want to watcha let's play of it on youtube tho i don't recommend it as these games are way better when played first hand.\n\n Overall i'd give it a 9/10 because i'm fully biased for the persona series and i think you should absolutely try this game and the series too.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eccf8d0bbb3151b9ba77dc87b809e3bd", "author": "e0e1a9eea14f5b68b0ceb108d0f20fe2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1323, "content": "PERSONA!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cfbb4f040d085f6a92d05bea880ded5e", "author": "3fa1830908155d6894252335b2934bfb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2732, "content": "Game is now playable, however its not exactly perfect, alot of people will experince crashes, but the game is playable now, and is fun as hell. good game, just keep fixing bugs Atlus", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2db8915e535d5bf8bf033a89ee5df29a", "author": "77a0f3145a4152e4b7f8fca048ef89b9", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3326, "content": "\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e Persona 5 (\u0438\u043b\u0438 Royal) -

The gameplay is very fun and what makes it even better is the fact that they made each and every character's kit and moveset completely unique on top of the mindblowing soundtrack (which is basically a given in any game in the franchise) and design. I am playing on hard difficulty just because I didn't want to blow through the game in a day and it pretty tough for me, as someone who hasn't really played this genre of game at all. But despite that, I've never once gotten irritated at failing multiple times in a fight, rather I think about what I could do differently until I figure out what works and what doesn't and amidst that, memorizing the movesets of the enemies until I eventually complete the encounter, feeling a sense of accomplishment after several failed attempts. That however is only the tip of the iceberg, it takes some of the core things from vanilla P5 and incorporates it quite smoothly into itself, which in turn makes it feel like a true successor to vanilla.

Just seeing these characters reunite brought a lump to my throat. So far, the writing has made each character actually feel slightly more impactful than in P5 as they seem to be all pulling their own weight in conversation and nobody is getting left behind *cough Yusuke/Haru*\n\nThe style is BACK, BABY! The menus are still incredibly satisfying to flit through, the all-out attacks feel better to enact than ever, and the new additions are all extremely welcome. The combat feels absolutely joyous and I have zero complaints about the change from turn-based to frantic hack and slash. \n\nMy only recommendations to the devs would be A: add widescreen support and B: give me better sound mixing as the effects seem a little too loud and drown out the music and VA which are both exceptional.\n\nThank you Atlus for bringing this game to the rest of the world and to PC!!!!

this after i finish the game to see if my mind changes. so basically ive played both base persona 5 and royal within the span of a year and really enjoyed the games due to the confidants, overall style of the game, ost, story, freedom to do whatever i want when i want up to a time limit, etc etc it was a really solid game. i also really enjoy jrgs so that also improved the experience for me. so when i heard that the spin off/ sequel of p5 would be a hack and slash rpg game instead i was a little offput by it but overtime as i heard and seen more about the game i decided to give it a shot even going as far as pre ordering it. about a week before the game drops early for before he spent 10 extra dollars (me) i get spoiled that they are no confidants in the game by an invasive ass article google shoved in my face so at that point im not feeling too good but nonetheless i was still hopeful for the game and waited. fast forward to when i install and launch the game and... bruh. while i was playing the whole time it felt like something was off and then i realized that they replaced all of the cool style font that would be at the top right and is used on the characters name with some generic ms word font. that alone is a major turn off for me. but like 5 more mins in when the squad needs to go buy supplies and shit its dropped that both the doctor and airsoft owners are both not in the game for some bullshit \"summer closing' reason. this made me wanna turn off the game tbh. they also made it to where you cant enter stores like you use to be able and its just a stock menu when you go to enter. instead in persona 5 where you can get supplies from a bunch of places theres now only one bitch boy store page to get weapons, armor, items, etc from and it feels like such a downgrade. overall so far this entire game feels like downgrade and im hoping im only being a giga bitch rn and the game gets better. oh and the combat is cool or whatever", "comments": 0, "source":

The story illustrates the growth of the Phantom Thieves and is fantastic. \n- Killer soundtrack. My favorite is Blooming Villan, River in the Desert, and Counterstrike. \n- Doesn't chug on 60 FPS. \n- The new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, are a fantastic addition to the cast. Usually the new characters tend to hog the spotlight or something but not too much with these two. \n- A Musou game that blends P5's style and system very well. \n- The right amount of difficulty. Once you cleared some hurdles, the game offers you the Merciless option (Risky in JP) and that'll definitely challenge the player's skill (to illustrate how hard Merciless is, you might die in the tutorial if you think you can just waltz in and tank everything). \n- New game plus option.\n\nCons\n- Map navigation might be a bit disorientating at first since you'll be going up and down and all over. I definitely got disorientated at the Shibuya Jail.\n- Inventory management could use some work. You'll be spending a good minute looking for the right recovery mid-fight. \n- You can't jump between Jail to Jail. This might be a bit tedious when you're trying to clear some requests. \n- The chaotic nature of a Musou game might catch some people off guard if they never played one. \n- You won't be able to swap out members mid battle like you did in P5 so if you run into a mid-boss that your not prepared for, you'll have a hard time. \n- A lot of Persona's were cut. This includes the awakened forms of your teammates. \n- Though your main attack is physical, physical Persona moves were nerfed. In P5S, the cost to use the physical Persona moves are based off your total HP and the skill that mitigates the cost of physical Persona moves isn't available. So yeah you can't go mindless and spam Yoshitsune's Hassotobi to decimate your foes. \n\nMix\n- A lot of the P5 casts won't be returning here.\n- Morally gray bosses.\n- The game doesn't really teach you some crucial tips. For example, you can use your items to recover during combat. I did not realize that after a couple of game overs. \n- The bosses are paired with one of your party members for story (for example, Alice and Ann). However, there are two characters that don't have that kind of scenario which is a bummer. However, those two shine throughout the story in general so it's not a total loss.\n- Though it said you'll be going all over Japan, it's more of a slice. I did wish we could explore real-world Kyoto.\n- No DLCs. This isn't a deal breaker (and it's not like DLC = win button) but I did wish we could use P4's Izanagi or P3's Thanatos and jam to Raidou's battle theme. \n- You won't be able to fight against attendants like you did in past Persona games unfortunately (usually they're set up as a hidden boss). However P5S still does it right and prepared a fan favorite of the Persona series as the hidden boss. \n\nConclusion\n- This is a game that I definitely would recommend to anyone who loves P5 or P5R and who's into Musou games. \n- Unlike a generic Musou games, it's very story heavy and won't get as repetitive (definitely a fresh take for me at least). \n- You will definitely tumble in the beginning as you get used to the battle system, but once you understand and master it, it's very fun. \n\nPS\nThe game definitely suffered a messaging issue upon it's first announcement (a lot of people thought it was going to be a generic Musou game with Persona characters thrown in it). After the first and second PV though, I think Atlus got the messaging issue fixed and assured the audience that this was a legit Persona game.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1561c5ad746e56c89287eb58769f7728", "author": "31ec71aa5c0a5c8284cd14fe27338309", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 12732, "content": "It amazing", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "65239d37e32c5da8bd742ccc05aab59e", "author": "c9d11f3138735f7594a56bae906c54d7", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1248, "content": "awesoime", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "2068301b658852ae8fcfa4aac43196b6", "author": "e7d163975d9e5a6795aef18a16bfdea8", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3316, "content": "If you played Persona 5, you will like this.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "43b13b14828c598b877780cfac3a48ba", "author": "187ccad4d2005fcbad8e416f7b3147a9", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 376, "content": "ta muy bueno no me quejo buena inversion", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "de792f1e430256539119b0576c651850", "author": "cdb3067b02345c989e9228a73e35fbe8", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2876, "content": "This game has no right to be as good as it is.\n\nThe story really picks up from the second jail and becomes an incredibly fun roadtrip for fans of Persona 5.

Una gran obra digna de suceder a su precuela que ahora sigue con las aventuras de Los Ladrones Fantasma a trav\u00e9s de todo Jap\u00f3n.\nEl juego se siente muy bien, las nuevas mec\u00e1nicas y estilo Hack And Slash le dan un respiro a las dem\u00e1s entregas anteriores que nos ven\u00edan ofreciendo el mismo sistema RPG que tanto amamos los fan\u00e1ticos y seguidores de la saga SMT y Persona. Admito que al principio no estaba muy convencido con el nuevo sistema de juego, pero una vez que te adentras en el es muy dif\u00edcil que no te sientas c\u00f3modo con el mismo.\n\n3 PUNTOS POSITIVOS\n* Mimo al alma de los fans: Atlus sabe como tratar a su audiencia. Ahora es posible jugar de manera libre con todos los Ladrones Fantasma y eso fue un punto muy positivo para el gameplay d\u00e1ndonos m\u00e1s variedad y la posibilidad de usar a nuestros personajes favoritos en combate. Cada personaje cuenta con sus propias habilidades y combos adem\u00e1s de sus ataques especiales invocando a su persona para castigar las debilidades de los enemigos. En el apartado est\u00e9tico, sigue conservando todo lo que nos gusta reciclando (para bien) los aspectos visuales que nos enamoraron por primera vez con P5. La m\u00fasica es otro punto muy positivo, en esta entrega no contamos directamente con la participaci\u00f3n de el maestro Shoji Meguro pero a cambio tuvimos nuevas nombres en los Soundtracks que demostraron estar a la altura del maestro con canciones como Axe To Grind, Counter Strike y, mi favorita, You Are Stronger. En la secci\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o no se queda atr\u00e1s para nada. Contamos con nuevos grandes personajes a la vez que tenemos a los jefes, que mas de una vez me dejaron boquiabierto y unos entornos nuevos y atrapantes.\n\n* Combates din\u00e1micos: Sabemos que los combates de la saga se caracterizaban por un sistema est\u00e1tico de golpes y habilidades por turnos al mas puro estilo RPG, ahora con P5S se le dio una vuelta de tuerca muy favorable que nos invita a ser atacantes mas directos y ofensivos en un sistema de combate din\u00e1mico y adictivo con muchas mec\u00e1nicas nuevas, ejecutando combos, utilizando objetos del entorno y magias para masacrar la mayor cantidad de enemigos posibles ganando as\u00ed m\u00e1s puntos y experiencia. La verticalidad de los niveles y la amplitud del campo de batalla son otros puntos muy acertados, d\u00e1ndonos esa sensaci\u00f3n de libertad al moverse por el metaverso como ninguna otra entrega anterior lo ha hecho.\n\n* Narrativa e historia: Si bien se nota a distancia que este juego no fue hecho con el mismo presupuesto que su obra maestra anterior P5 o P5R, la historia de Strikers esta muy lograda. Se nota esa familiaridad y cari\u00f1o entre los personajes que ya conocemos y los nuevos que se ir\u00e1n integrando poco a poco avance la trama. Realmente se siente como una secuela y no como un Spinoff m\u00e1s de la franquicia como en otras entregas anteriores.\n\n3 PUNTOS NEGATIVOS\n* Algunas cosas se extra\u00f1an: Si algo se caracteriz\u00f3 la obra maestra anterior fue por tener muchas mec\u00e1nicas divertidas que aportaban variedad y personajes hermosos que lamentablemente no contamos en este juego. Hay cosas con las que no contamos como el celular, pescar, las quest secundarias o incluso pasear libremente por la ciudad (y no solo en un minimapa con dos o tres tiendas). Y en cuanto a los personajes, podr\u00edan haber hecho como m\u00ednimo un cameo y no solo cancelarlos con excusas vagas o directamente ni si quiera mencionarlos ya que en la precuela fueron emblem\u00e1ticos e importantes tanto para el jugador como para el protagonista. Personajes como Igor, Mishima, Iwai o Takemi fueron de los que m\u00e1s se not\u00f3 el hueco (eso sin contar a Yoshizawa o Maruki sean canon o no).\n\n* A veces se espera un poco m\u00e1s: Si bien el combate es excelente y din\u00e1mico como mencione anteriormente, a veces peca de ser repetitivo y termina cansando. Muchas peleas solo se basan en spamear botones a lo bestia y rara vez castear una magia para debilitar a un oponente medianamente fuerte, eso si no es que antes moris debido a la exagerada cantidad de cosas y explosiones que hay en pantalla simult\u00e1neamente y que son en extremo molestas. Los combates de la primera c\u00e1rcel pueden ser desafiantes y hasta exigentes para los mas novatos, pero una vez que aprendiste los controles y sabes usar a los personajes, la curva de dificultad del juego desciende y se vuelve un paseo de golpes sin miedo a perder nada por el camino. Incluso algunas peleas contra jefes est\u00e1n muy chupadas, el mismo juego te dice que lanzarle para hacerle mas da\u00f1o o cuando hay que hacerle cierto movimiento especial.\n\n* Recorte de contenido: Este es el punto mas perdonable. El juego es hermoso, no me malinterpreten, pero si hay muchas cinem\u00e1ticas, momentos y transiciones que se notan muy vagas o poco pulidas. Quisiera creer que es por cuestiones de presupuesto y en ese caso es aceptable, pero me pas\u00f3 en muchos momentos donde los personajes fuera del metaverso solo se limitaban a quedarse quietos hablando sin ninguna expresi\u00f3n o incluso moverse de forma tosca. \n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, 8.5 de 10\nGracias por leer.\nPD: PERSONA 5 ROYAL PC 2021 LO QUIEROOOOO ATLUS LCDTM PONETE LAS PILAS", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c6402faae5fc5033ad5ad36e1cef2d00", "author": "7901e2bc7f0d541aa06dcfc8dac2dbb2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 921, "content": "*I ordered the digital deluxe edition so I was able to play early*\n\nThis game has a problem for me on fullscreen mode as the game will not load after launching my save file.

The dungeon crawling feels a lot \"stiff\" compared to its JRPG counter part.

The Persona summons are definitely fun to use, however (and this is just a minor gripe on my half) SP in the beginning of the game is so scarce and that most of the time I am actually fighting SP-less. \n\nOverall, I am happy that this game is able to differentiate itself from other musou-type games, and it is definitely unique on its own. \n\nTo end off, Sophia is very adorable, and I think she's a great inclusion to the cast so far.

The game feels right at home on PC.

I think this is one area that new players will miss out in terms of cohesion. The game feels like a true squeal, playing P5/P5R prior does make for a better experience. \n\nThe game doesn't have many bugs, if any. There is an anti aliasing issue with the in-game settings. It just doesn't look sharp to me. But this is easily fixed by disabling the in-game setting and enabling anti aliasing via Nvidia control panel. I recommend upping the resolution scale as well if your PC can handle it. The game looks incredible with graphical tweaks; literally go crazy in the NV control panel. The game is only 60fps so you can tick all the boxes and still performs well. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a worthy addition, highly stylistic, great soundtrack, lovable cast and the new gameplay style just works.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f0964d8b25c15163b1584df454a80747", "author": "f9e51558c488540488f10b7c90e4859a", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3598, "content": "Feels like a mainline Persona game, a great step above every other Persona spinoff.

While I'm very excited to see more persona titles on steam, such as 4 golden, and 5 strikers, I really hope we see more of the main games ported. Persona 3, Persona 5, ect. If you've played and enjoyed persona 5, you'll probably like strikers. The same characters are back for a \"Vacation\" story focused around old friends getting back together.  The gameplay is solid, the anime cutscenes are high quality, and the graphics are very pretty! This game is great on the couch with a controller, or with a keyboard and mouse, although I prefer this as a couch title personally. If you haven't played persona 5 yet, you might not enjoy this game as much. I'm sure it would feel similar to joining a well established friend group, and realizing you kinda get most of the insight jokes, but that you also have a sense of loss that you weren't there when they were created. Regardless, story isn't the only attraction here, and the gameplay is solid enough that I can still recommend strikers to someone who hasn't played persona 5. That being said, Atlus, please give us persona 3 and persona 5 on steam. The whole \"Steam vs other platforms such as epic\" argument might sound shallow on paper, but steam is offering so many wonderful features that no other storefront can. A big example of this is Proton support, which allows windows games to run on linux. Valve is hardware and software agnostic, allowing many gamers to come together and enjoy their favorite titles in the way they'd like. I'm happy to support Atlus on my platform of choice, as it is a platform that supports my freedom of choice. Here's to more wonderful persona games coming to steam in the future. We're glad to have you here! \n\nBest Regards, -PR0XIDIAN", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "61acb72381bd583e9f05bb65e8d7a098", "author": "08d6ead0b78650fc9ab13b959d9f4355", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1659, "content": "Love it !!!\n\n\n\nEdit : okay after playing over 20hr, i think this game too repetitive, that's not really my taste, so i need to change my mind", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "407668b979b95ced8e93bc25cc3ee633", "author": "c3b08390160452c48d415e11ae7b628b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5447, "content": "I'm not a fan of this warrior type games but if you love Persona you are going to enjoy a lot this sequel.

It translates surprising well to an action based hack and slash. There will be an adjustment period for anyone who's previously played a persona game because several of the button assignments are different to compensate for the new combat (like the persona summoning menu is now a special attack button).  The platforming is also no longer on rails for the most part, so movement is a bit more choppy than it was in persona 5.\n\nHowever, after an hour or two of getting used to fighting, its a surprisingly rewarding experience. It emphasizes reflexes and situational awareness to dodge attacks and use combos to fire off skills seamlessly. As well as rewarding persona building, because having the right set of skills to hit weaknesses or apply crowd control can be the a major factor in how smoothly a fight will go.\n\nHard mode even provides a pleasant challenge, forcing you to pay attention in most encounters, or else you most likely be overwhelmed by enemy abilities and attacks. Forcing you to really dive into the combat system, and learn to string together combos and dodging efficiently.\n\nI was expecting something good as a spin off, but it went beyond my expectations into a great game to play on its own.

This is actually what a non Turn-role Persona game would be like. It is more of a Persona game than a Dynasty Warrior clone.\n\nThe game takes place after the event of Persona 5 during the summer vacation as the Phantom Thieves yet again find theirselves in another quest to change hearts.\n\nGameplay; Smooth 60fps locked. No drops. it is to be noted that some cutscenes are running at 30fps but there isnt many of them. The key bindings isn't that bad and it is easy to learn them and can be changed if you need to. The combat is very fast paced and the mechanics are well implemented. I'd give it a 9/10.\n\nGraphics: They are not bad but also not superb due to something that looks like a lack of strong AA but overall they are fine. 7.5/10\n\nSpecs needed: This game is not very demanding and even 700 series GTX cards can handle it fine as long as you tune the settings a bit. 8/10.\n\nMusic: Now this is the part that is actually an absolute hit. If you do buy the digital deluxe edition you have access to battle ost from previous persona games ranging from Persona revelation up to Persona 5 Strikers. The sound quality in Persona games is alway top notch and this one delivers as well. 9.5/10.\n\nFinal thoughts: Should you buy it? I would say wait for sales because, the standard version really doesn't shine like the digital deluxe edition with all its bonuses. However, for long time persona fans, I doubt this will be too much of a concern to them. I should also mention that , even if you did not play Persona 5 this is not an issue as this game seems to be a total different setting. Also thanks to Koei Tecmo for making this game with Atlus.\n\nMy overall score: 8.5/10.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "036c365c0ee5500e8c8b4b9a20d58057", "author": "27ff10175ecc5051ab5feed9da78a9b3", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 7641, "content": "With this game being in a somewhat unique situation, there's three main areas I want to address in this review: playing this game without playing Persona 5, the state of the PC port, and the game itself. \n\nPC Port up first! The port is very simplistic unfortunately. No ultrawide support, capped at 60fps, and limited settings to adjust (there is an internal resolution scaler though, which can go up to 2.0). The port runs well though - I have an 8700k and a 3080, and I've had basically a locked 60fps at 1440p with all settings maxed and the scaler set to 2.0 (and I haven't hit any bugs yet, but I've only played for a few hours). I imagine that this game will be able to run on a very wide variety of PCs, which is good. One minor complaint I do have however is that the UI is pretty big, and there's no option to re-size it. It's not too much of an issue when running around the world, but during battle it very much gets in the way. \n\nWhat's not good is that you really shouldn't play this game if you haven't played Persona 5 (And like many, I am absolutely baffled that they haven't brought P5 to PC yet. Especially with this game being a direct sequel). Not only will you spoil some great P5 moments for yourself, but this game doesn't really do anything to hold your hand story-wise. It does some very baseline \"story setup\" in regards to the overall world and lore, but it very much assumes that you've played Persona 5 (or are at least very familiar with it and the characters). So if you haven't played, chances are that you'll have no idea what on earth is happening or who any of these characters are. \n\nAs for the game itself, so far I'm enjoying it! I'm not completely sold on the combat yet (which I'll get to a bit later), but the game feels like a legitimate Persona 5 sequel. I don't know how much of a hand that Atlus had in development and how much was Omega Force, but this game feels right at home with Persona 5 in terms of the writing and character interactions. As always, the voice actors have brought their A-game (I'm playing with English VO) and they do just as great of a job as in P5. Omega Force has introduced a few new characters as well, and they all feel like they just fit right in. I'm sure you'll have heard about Sophia by the time you play, and yes - she is as precious as everyone says she is. \n\nHowever, don't go in expecting a full-blooded Persona game. As far as I'm aware, there are no confidant levels, no school, no social stats to level up, etc. While this absolutely feels like a proper sequel in terms of tone and design, just remember that it's a Persona-themed hack and slash game, and not an actual Persona game proper. And with that, we come to the combat! Which is hard to give a full opinion on because I've only played the game for a few hours but I'm going to do my best to give my thoughts as I have them. \n\nConceptually, I love combat (also as a note, I'm playing with a PS4 controller so I'll be referring to it for the button layout). Each character has standard attacks that you'll button mash with the Square button, a special attack (that can be weaved into combos) that's mapped to Triangle, and their persona which is summoned by holding down R1. Hitting Triangle will do different things depending on when it's used in a combo. Using Triangle does something different than if hitting it after hitting Square 2 times, or 3, or 4 (each one presents a different ability). While each character performs combos in the same way (each character has a Square + Triangle combo, a Square + Square + Triangle combo, etc) they do different things for each character, and it can be a bit overwhelming to keep it all straight. However, I imagine that this will naturally dissipate as the game is played for longer. \n\nWhen holding down R1 to summon your persona, battle freezes - this lets you choose your persona/ability and choose the area to deploy it at your leisure. You can switch between any party member at any time if they're in your current party (you're still limited to 4 party members, but these party members can be switched when not in combat), and you can even run around as your chosen party member while in the Metaverse, which I really like. When a typical battle starts, you'll run into one of 3 enemy types: general blade fodder, personas, and \"boss\" personas. The blade fodder are just faceless enemies that you can hack and slack your way through, and don't present any challenge at all. Personas are the personas that we know and love from P5, and this is where you'll want to use the correct party member/persona ability to target their affinities. \"Boss\" personas (I put boss in quotes because it's not an actual boss, they're just tougher versions of the normal personas) can take multiple affinity hits before getting knocked down, and are generally tougher to kill/do more damage. \n\nThere's a lot more to combat, but that's the elevator pitch. Why am I hesitant on it? Because honestly, at times it feels very frantic and unfocused. As mentioned at the beginning, the battle UI takes up way too much of your screen. It's at least 1/4, if not 1/3 of your screen real estate. Add to that all of your party members mashing their standard attack and sending off persona abilities, plus the enemies are doing the same, it results in so much visual overload that I can barely keep track of what's going on. The game recommends trying to use different party members to chain together combos and such, but I can barely keep track of what's going on - there's no way I'll be able to chain things together efficiently. It's also difficult to keep track of your own health - the in-game characters will sound off voice dialogue to let you know that your health is getting low, but sometimes you miss it with the amount of stuff happening on screen and it all just feels a little hectic. \n\nAll that being said, I'm still enjoying the game thoroughly. This is about as close to a \"Persona 5 2\" as we'll ever get, and it's a damn fine follow up. When you're only facing a few enemies and can actually pull off the combos that the game wants you to, it's very satisfying. I'm hoping that my problems with the combat will go away as I get more used to it, but only time will tell there (I'll most likely update this review after finishing the game).

Although the fix on the forum says that to roll back the driver to 460.79, I was on that version of the driver, so I tried my luck updating the driver and it surprisingly fixed the problem. It was hell of a journey, and I don't think this game is worth recommending to others unless there is a patch coming out addressing all the crashes and porting problems.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated March 3rd\nI cannot proceed to play the game. I got stuck after the boss fight in 5th jail. Infinite loading black screen. Funny thing is every time I close the game I can here a bit audio as if the game has not crashed. This is a problem faced by many other players and I have tried all kinds of fixed but none really worked.\n[spoiler]I have fight my copy for more than 10 times now and I am literally speed running the boss fight. I am tired.[/spoiler]\n\nI have point out many other bugs brought by the port but none really affected my experience this much.

Although the quality of the animation isn't the highest, it covers all the important stories and can get enough background information to not get lost playing this game.\n\nAs for the game itself, so far so good.

Especially when I load up the game, it usually takes me 10 to 15 seconds to actually be able to play the game. I am not sure the problem can be fixed, and it is rather minor problem, but this will be frustrating after more hours of playtime, which I know I will be having. Another thing that stands out to me is that although I am playing this game on a controller, the character can only move along the 8 axis using the left stick. This is definitely bad porting, and I haven't experienced anything like this on other ported games like Yakuza series or Atlus' own Persona 4 Golden.\n\nGameplay is solid so far, but also missing out on a lot of thing that really made persona series stands out from other JRPG games - daily interactions. While the game still using the calendar system like its predecessors, there are less layer to that because you are free to spend however long time you want in one day and do whatever you want. Being able to go and return palace (jails) freely without worrying about time passing is more player-friendly, but it feels like cheating to just freely go in and out to recover your hp and sp.\nUp till this point of the game, I haven't had any side stories and bonding time with other characters. The city has much less things to explore and places to go. Although it seems like we got to visit more cities, so that might still be fun.\nI guess I just miss the time to spend with all my [spoiler]waifus[/spoiler]friends and school life.\nThe fighting is fun, and the way the incorporate the old persona system to this musou type game is very interesting.\n\nA solid 8/10 so far. Definitely recommend if you have played Persona 5 before, and worth to play if you haven't and don't mind missing out on some stories or spend time watching the anime series", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "207d3e97b680556eb3b45cd9eef747fc", "author": "7d24d86c57ab5d0180b05fdb28ab558c", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3088, "content": "mmmmmmmm good game yes yes. joe car with the arson purseowner yes yes.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7fa26ff29c775081a87afd4f6fc98fac", "author": "47cabc7436c858cfaa93b339b2564263", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4221, "content": "oui.

the persona battle elements keep it from being like other hack and slash type games, so if you're not a fan of those this might still be worth a try. the story is a direct sequel to persona 5 and it doesn't offer much explanation so definitely play that before picking this up! ive had minor issues with crashing and a few animations are a little wonky, but otherwise its a very good game - just be sure to save often :) here's a few fyis for people playing:\n\nthe preset keyboard controls are a nightmare. i highly recommend using a controller, but if you really don't want to then be sure to go into config and reset them to whatever works for you. once you get past the main menu you have to play through the entire prologue before getting the chance to do it again so this is super important if you dont want to be reaching over to press H and N constantly! \n\nyou can leave the metaverse at any checkpoint, with no time penalty. if you're low on sp just leave and immediately come back, there's no reason not to. you should also be using healing skills more often than items, because there's essentially an infinite supply of sp. save your healing items for battles.\n\nsimilar to the last game, its best that everyone stays alive, even if they're at 1 hp. losing a party member means losing a quarter of total damage. however, in this game, joker dying isnt an instant game over. to lose, *every* party member has to die, not just the protag. if the character you're playing is low on health, switch to another. the ai will automatically keep them away from danger (mostly) and you can get back to fighting.\n\nyou start the game with joker, then unlock everybody else at once so it can be kind of overwhelming. every character is fairly well balanced so just play whoever you like most. i use ann and yusuke often because they're fast and do quick damage, but if you prefer more hard hitting characters ryuji and haru are a good choice. sophie and makoto are both a moderate between those. you unlock 'arts' while playing a character, which gives them new moves and other helpful stuff. once you've unlocked all of a character's arts, its good to switch to a new one so that you can have a party thats all boosted!\n\nin the game, confidants are replaced by a bond level. when your bond levels up you get bond points, which you can use to get upgrades. i highly recommend 'strength boost', which increases everyone's physical attack damage (essentially 90% of the damage you'll be doing), as well as ambusher and oracle recovery, which both restore hp after battles.\n\nfusion accidents happen CONSTANTLY, i dont know if its just my bad luck or something but it feels like 1 out of every 5 is an accident, so don't get too attached to whatever you're fusing.\n\nanyways its a really fun game!!!!!

Vous aurez vite fait du lore lors des dialogues, mais c'est tr\u00e8s minime et vous aurez beaucoup moins d'attache aux personnages et \u00e7a c'est ce qui coince.\n\nCar oui les personnages, anciens comme nouveaux, sont cools bordel !

Takes the best elements of the original game and adds new twists to the gameplay/design to make something new. \n\nGameplay:\n\nI absolutely adored the turn-based RPG system from the original Persona 5 so I was a bit skeptical with the warriors gameplay that this game as going with. I'm happy to report that I was wrong and the gameplay works extremely well. Its fast, hectic, and makes you think about personas you should use instead of just using physical attacks. This is my first warriors game but If the rest of the games are this fun, I may need to investigate the series further.\n\nStory: \n\nThe story is your usual phantom thieves affair, taking them on a road trip around japan to new locations in the meta-verse. I finished my first play through of Persona 5 around this time last year so starting this game felt like a reunion with some old friends. The writing is on par with P5's writing and has already made me laugh out loud a few times already.\n\nPC Aspect:\n\nThis game runs perfectly on my 3070. You most likely won't need something that new to run it but it looks amazing with newer hardware. I haven't ran into too many bugs besides the occasional half-second stutter when entering into the meta-verse and some character dialogue sounding a bit drowned out from the music. \n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes what I loved about Persona 5 and makes something out of it. I've been grinning at every little detail or reference to the original game and it makes me feel like I'm actually playing full on sequel to the original game. I would highly encourage you to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal (Be warned, this game is a sequel to base Persona 5 so most story additions from Royal will not be present in this) before you play this though. Speaking of, I do hope that the success of this amazing PC port will get us Persona 5 Royal on steam soon. The Persona series fits perfectly on the steam platform and I'm down to have Persona on my PC. \n\nI don't like rating games with numbers but this is the exception. This game for me is a solid 10/10. Highly encourage you to play this game.\n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3f52bc03e758580fab976ee63af763dc", "author": "66da4f428b1157f4b6735a3b221c569a", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 518, "content": "Game crashes on startup for me after successfully playing with no issues yesterday.

The score is pure vibe gold.\n2. The menu screens, transitions, animations are all amazing.\n3. The fight scenes feel very fluid while sticking to the Persona game theme very well. \n4. The story, this might be a personal preference, but I really do love the story. \n5. Mechanical skills and awareness feels rewarding. Dodging at the right time, using the right abilities on the right targets at the right time, it all rewards you in spades.\n\nI have some pet peeves with the game, albeit not enough to stop me from enjoying the game. \n1. The jagged lines and horrendous AA implementation kind of bothers me at times\n2. I can't find as many sort orders as the other games, kind of makes things harder to search for, when you want to search for a specific persona.\n3.

Now, let's not get ahead and say this is a typical \"Musou\" game. It is VERY different and the differences (both small and big) are what make this game truly unique, interesting and an incredible game for a spin-off in the Persona series.\n\nEach character plays differently. That is, each relies on their own mechanic to be successful (eg. Skull with power attacks that can be charged and can reduce the damage he takes). Environments while recycled at times have placeholders for you to take advantage of (phantom dashes) and cities feel quite alive despite the lack of available interactions (most of your gameplay will be spent dungeon crawling).\n\nDifficulty determines how long you will have to grind the first (and possibly second) dungeon to be able to sufficiently tackle the rest of the game without experiencing too much problems. The story was to be expected like that of Persona 5 itself, but seems to strike somewhat more grand targets with the added anime tropes and flairs to give enough fan service. If the game isn't hard enough, you can unlock the hardest difficulty by beating the game. So there's plenty for those who want to do challenging runs.\n\nAction in this game will overwhelm you and greatly with how each character is played as the tutorial is rather basic (a small mixture of intro fights to reading the tutorials in the system menu). As you get used to the action, it will go from small amounts of frustration to mass entertainment as you unlock more mechanics and skills.\n\nPresentation. Just about everything in this game has been well done. Some voices can get repetitive when navigating the UI, but enough variety has been put in to avoid it. If you're a little bit on the nit picky side, some of the voice edits they have done have resulted in voices being drowned out near the final part of the phrase, immediate follow-ups, to minor grammatical errors (only found in dialogue). This is only a personal opinion, but if this affects you, just pretend you didn't see the text.\n\nMusic. If only the Deluxe edition actually gave you the music files instead of it being locked in the game, this would have made it perfect. The soundtrack is extraordinary, but to be stuck to listening to it in a 'separate' game hurts the experience. I'd love it if they made it fully accessible.\n\nNow for PC problems. The 60 FPS cap is regrettable to say the least, but messing around with any of the settings other than low/medium/high will often result in poor performances. I know there are fixes in the discussion forums, but to make it simple, only touch the first setting (low/med/high), and leave the rest alone (especially resolution scale as this one resulted in a few crashes ranging from losing 20 minutes to 1 hour of game time).\n\nPrice. Perhaps a lot was done to make this a reality, but the price is still extreme and I was seriously debating not purchasing it on price alone. It took a change of heart, but let's not go stealing desires Atlus.\n\nI am looking forward to see if they have plans for future spin-offs.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d9e9da0844145b5da41c1002d16369b6", "author": "07c712b0a67357c9aca9045ba02fd3c0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3068, "content": "The first stepping stone of Persona 5: Royal coming to PC & Switch.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "91af27f81e9b528199ca85b6b8a80765", "author": "31277ba795a75063bc6c75b881dccca0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4285, "content": "Ryoji snowman bruh", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4d8c954be37d51b782c3a1720e306e1f", "author": "bd6f989af0fc5177a2e73385413eaab1", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5996, "content": "HARU COMO TE AMO!

Dialogue is funny, but has its cringe moments, so classic Persona.\n\nHow turn-based Persona mechanics would translate to the Warriors style gameplay was what I was most interested in when I heard about Scramble, and having put a good amount of time into Strikers, I can say that it flows together near seamlessly. There's a bit of a learning curve, I died a fair amount on the first few bosses, but once you get a feel for the flow of combat, you can string together some nasty combos. This made the second major boss feel like a cakewalk in comparison, not because it was easier in difficulty, but because I knew how to use my SP and movement more effectively. I'm near the end of the third \"dungeon\" and this pattern has continued. XP and money grinding is always available, and when the game says leaving the dungeon has no downside, it means there's literally no downside. Just wait like 1 minute for the cutscenes, then reenter to find all your SP refilled. This all makes it so that even if you suck like I did at first, you can still progress through brute force, though learning the mechanics is your best bet, as that one minute of Mementos' \"woahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoah\" cutscenes will get annoying.\n\nDefinitely a worthwhile pickup for fans of P5, and one of the best Warriors-style games I've played.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7794a9f58fb4583c9a1bd3fabed47c7e", "author": "5d33582f2c7c5bd49d8a4ab9ab3d8deb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 363, "content": "Kasumi best girl", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "384a833b1d215318b11409fa49711983", "author": "59999e197a855768a9aeecb692d75978", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4175, "content": "I wish Zenkichi was my dad.

That's not saying it's a bad story line, but it is rather similar and some parts are lifted from the original games. I'll put anything spoil related at the far bottom so if anyones not played, they can't see it. My pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-The combat is FANTASTIC. Going into this, I had a hard time getting used to it, because I was used to the slower combat from Persona 5, but this... hits so hard, literally. The combat feels so heavy, and that in my personal opinion makes games like this great. \n-The dialogue is cheesy at times, but there are so many moments that I laughed my ass off due to comedic timing, and just Yusuke being Yusuke. There are many screenshots I hold dearly from this game of the dialogue. \n-The music is OUTSTANDING. I remember hearing River in the Desert for the first time in Persona 5, and I remember how badass it sounded. But they literally looked at the original soundtrack, took the best songs and said: \"Hey, let's make this more kickass\". Believe it or not, it's more kickass. Rivers in the Desert, Last Surprise and most importantly, Daredevil, the 3rd version of Life will Change if you will. These songs made this game SO good, because you felt the pressure, and high tension. I listen to these songs out of game, they're that good. Also Sophia's shop's theme SLAPS.\n-The art style is so good. The cities you visit feel like a snapshot from real life and pasted into this game with a hint of that really colorful Persona style. \n-The bosses are actually really good. Usually in a game like this, there are a lot of lackluster bosses and the mini bosses are easy and boring. But they did something really interesting with the Request system, where later in the game, you can get requests to beat the boss of the city again, beat really powerful shadows around the area, or just farm. Personally speaking, I liked the Warden system, which are essentially mini bosses before the main boss. They give you a feel for the \"villain\", and give them character, which makes a good antagonist. (Sapporo boss is a meme tho, it's honestly funny to play, but fun)\n-Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are AMAZING. The devs took the idea of All-Out Attacks from the original game and pumped it with CRACK. When you see the way it's used in Persona 5 and can find it a little confusing on how you implement it in this game, and I was there at the beginning, but they managed to make it incredibly smooth, which kind of ties into the combat part, but this is separated because there will never be a better feeling than having finishing a strong shadow off with Ryuji leading an All-Out Attack and finishing it with: \"S E E  Y A ! !\"\n-The fact that you can play as the other characters is so amazing. Ambushing enemies as Yusuke, him saying \"I shall expose you.\" in the most composed matter, man, you can't ask for better.\n-THE GAME DOESN'T END IF JOKER DIES!!\n-Level design is SUPERB. This does tie with the art style aspect, but I just have to shout out how good the Shibuya level looks and sounds. The music and levels work SO well. \n-The new characters are so good man, I can't express how much I love Zenkichi. The way he plays off the rest is so natural and hilarious. Sophia is adorable and we must protect her. \n-It is mandatory to bring up Ryuji saying the F word. (Fun fact, the F word is used twice in this entire game, once by Ryuji, and once by a flashback shadow)\n-They started using 3D cutscenes and they are amazing, please do that more often Atlus.\n\nCons:\n-The animation is a liiitle weird at times. My main issue with this is how lifeless everyone looks when they're chilling in the van or just in cutscenes. At times it was just funny how their blank expressions would never change when they would chant \"Yeah! Let's infiltrate this jail!\". \n-The story is a little strange. It is a typical JRPG at times and it reeeally shows. I'll continue my thoughts further down. \n-The music is a little loud when you first launch the game, and you can't change it if you start a new game after a while of cut scenes, which leads me into my next point:\n-There are a little too many cut scenes at times. It was clear that there were a lot of shortcuts taken with cut scenes and how they skip around. I know this is a nitpick, but with how good this game is, that's really what it comes to. \n-The combat *can* get repetitive, but if you really think about it, that's the same case with Persona 5, but this game is about 40 hours shorter than the original. \n-I did mention earlier that the dialogue is amazing, but there was some dialogue that made me cringe. But then again, it's a typical JRPG in that regard. They could have cut down on how many times they say ones name when that particular person is upset or expressing something. \n-I don't know if this is just me, but I had issues with crashing. There were many times in my play through that I would beat a boss, relieved, then mid cut scene, the game would freeze and then crash. \n-The limited supplied for cooking is frustrating, but I totally understand why they did that, because cooked items are *busted* if you save them for future battles. \n\nShould you play Persona 5 before this? Yes. \n\nIs it necessary? No, but it is highly recommended, due to a lot of references to the previous games (except Maruki, like what) \n\nIs this game worth the price? Yes. I know that's up for debate, but honestly, you can get a *lot* of hours in this game, which is what makes games worth their price. If I'm being honest, I could've spent up to 70-80 hours if I 100%ed it, but I every request except the Prison mails. \n\nIs Deluxe worth it? As someone who purchased the deluxe, I will say that it's not necessarily worth the extra $10, but it is nice to be able to change your battle music and see art for the game. \n\n10/10 Game. \n\n*SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT*\n\n\n\n\n\n-The story is verrrrry similar to Persona 5, in the sense that you fight a god, again. I kind of see why they did that, but it was rather recycled, due to EMMA looking extremely similar to the final boss from P5. Was it fun? Yes, the only reason really is the aspect of splitting everyone into three groups to finish EMMA off. I will give kudos to that, which is a good idea for a final boss. I will say this: The cut scene of everyone finishing off EMMA in an All-Out Attack, is SO good. Everyone got proper screen time, including Haru. \n-Sophia going with Ichinose is so wholesome, it made my heart feel good :)\n-Zenkichi catching Owada is so heartwarming :)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f188719612d35d4c9d48775a91c5748b", "author": "f13745c5c2385bdb9af5d56b4af3708f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5064, "content": "Joker Persona 5 can ride a skateboard", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "001e87d84242501eb40ffd02078223e7", "author": "59964b86116053a9afa78b888cb49b70", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 718, "content": "I mean its persona 5 ofc its good.\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "df73cdff4b05533d8c972de31f99623b", "author": "88d1c588ce405cb6b1f46aba193d5060", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3020, "content": "person", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "61a6060d0f24555584650fa505d6bd77", "author": "0e312b0a3d705bfeb3b4e6412e782fb0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2233, "content": "It's Persona 5 - 2. Which is awesome, if you already know Persona 5, not so much if you don't. This game often references the past story/game and does not go out of its way to tell you wtf happened in the first game (you should play it tho, it's really good). The combat is much less Dynasty Warriors than anticipated on my part, it's deep and kinda challenging, especially at bosses. It's very story driven, so if long cutscenes bore you, you might aswell skip that game because this game does contain a lot of story only times with no gameplay at all.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3174c60a80e9580b9114a22fe67ac3c3", "author": "b6412136577c54be9385c7d0ee676204", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2201, "content": "[h1] ATLUS will steal your wallet!

Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now. Persona 5 Strikers was an incredible experience that I can't wait to play over and over again to 100% and the point where I have every Persona completely maxed out. I'm incredibly happy to see that ATLUS doesn't need to make a JRPG to have an incredible entry into the Persona franchise.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d452700d19de589ba8ea213b2e71c68c", "author": "6aabe52acab55f088040f7092ff3f134", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4975, "content": "pancakes", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8349c7aeac31531a891633a85b5c41a6", "author": "6a7cbaec29235959b5429b5a20b38655", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2449, "content": "es tener la misma sensaci\u00f3n de ver a tus viejos amigos.\n\n\n\nolviden el cambio del gameplay, esta bien bueno el juego, sigue siendo persona", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9b59af21ac7952d48938231ee115360e", "author": "d42cff7b9a9659219ff51c086f6183ec", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3225, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers on the PC", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 2, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5860aaa8fcec557192bc57790e1d7512", "author": "7b21f0976e3e5d3d874d19fa9209572e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2072, "content": "So I was a fan of P5, got my hands on P5R and I got myself a copy of P4G and luckily P3FES.

And the dungeons have also been simplified to match the new gameplay style, while retaining jokers ability to switch persona on the fly and some element of party management and group control / move selection in order to retain the persona series feeling, however has ripped away the confidant system to be replaced by \"bonds\", which are upgrade-able by the player at any point, each providing its own unique buff. \n\nThe game does try to introduce new ideas like this, however the concept is still the same as in previous games with antagonists becoming corrupted enough to create their own alternate reality. However there's a slight change here which allows the Jail Monarch to control people in the real world, forcing the Phantom Thieves to travel around Japan to stop them.\n\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers isn\u2019t as compelling or thought provoking as its predecessors, yet the game is filled with fan service, and numerous references to the characters backstories and events from previous games, which for fans of the series is excellent and not forced, however for newcomers to the series will be just a tad confusing as none of them are explained. \n\nIt looks amazing retaining its slick punchy style and surreal colour schemes, each cutscene and special move have been choreographed carefully to capture each character's personality. In this regard Strikers still feels very much like a Persona game and hasn\u2019t lost any of its charm, with voice acting to match, it's hard to call this a spin-off, clearly time and effort was taken with this rather than just being a money grab. \n\nOverall, although it's shifted from its winning JRPG formula, the gameplay, narrative, story line and combat are all well worth playing through the 30 (ish) hour campaign for, however only for fans of the series, i'd generally say this is an awful entry point for new players, and to pick up p4 and p5 first.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "92292b80b83956dc94ba931962faaa4a", "author": "0d84232eab435281a814a54022ef6a55", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 382, "content": "Makoto best waifu!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d77ef7cef58358d9b0f46fd935125234", "author": "c499f46e9704538f9605e2c9b1b2c761", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2791, "content": "the chocolate milk truck", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4300008cc0285cf79a42662b088d5f5c", "author": "e15f325c4171518ea339b9d135244f12", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2695, "content": "From what I've played so far I am instantly invested.
