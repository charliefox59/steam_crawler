But, I was ultimately wrong and this game is nearly identical to the original Persona 5 game. I really enjoyed the gameplay and I enjoy the story so far.

It doesn't play very smooth at all and I spent a pretty significant amount of time in the key-bindings menu trying to get things squared away. The issue was that there are so many commands, but the keyboard & mouse setup is designed as if you're just playing with keyboard, so the same buttons used to for left and right mouse are in the immediate area of WASD. This would be fine, if it didn't \"push\" other important commands to further locations from my hand on the keyboard, causing me to have to adjust my hand placement on the keyboard pretty regularly during fights until I changed the settings.\n\nThis isn't something that makes me regret getting the game, and I absolutely LOVE it now that I've adjusted things. Super fun and entertaining successor to the original game. \n\n*Minor Spoiler*\n\nJust wanted knew players to be aware of this concern I had because the beginning of the game is heavy on combat tutorials. So even though it was guiding me how to play, it doesn't change the ease by which you can actually play. This detracted from my ability to fully dive into the introductory plot. Something that I definitely think the company should attempt to update in the future or at least learn from for future games.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c3a3a9f5d20d502cad4c84294513fc1c", "author": "7157ccd0154259c6b3225356bf601cac", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1500, "content": "Bring more Atlus game to PC please.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "75e2c3c43cd85008be0a91bed6e143fd", "author": "856e44d250a45ff68158ed51f23b82b3", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 35, "content": "\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8bfb\u53d6\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5565\u4f1a\u8fd9\u4e48\u6162\uff0c\u8fdb\u6e38\u620f\u7b492\u5206\u949f\u4ee5\u4e0a\u624d\u80fd\u8fdb\u5f00\u5934\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u53ea\u8981\u5207\u6362\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u8bfb\u53d6\u51e0\u5341\u79d2\uff0c\u6362\u56fa\u6001\u4e5f\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u770b\u8ba8\u8bba\u533a\u4e0d\u5c11\u4eba\u90fd\u4e5f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u5374\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4d3e7a0472a654048778ecbd9e6026f1", "author": "ef70d04ee62652e88e361690feef7da2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2771, "content": "juego pa bueno por la cresta", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "01d7d4c2ce095f08ab9e1da5600d76a0", "author": "8f8257329d9a5af4bd990d446226c7da", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2498, "content": "\u53bb\u5e74\u5728Steam\u73a9\u904e\u300aP4G\u300b\u5f8c \u7acb\u523b\u5c31\u641e\u4e86\u4e00\u53f0PS4\u9678\u7e8c\u73a9\u4e86\u300aP5R\u300b\u8ddf\u300aP5S\u300b\n\u300aP5S\u300b\u628a\u300a\u5973\u795e\u7570\u805e\u93045\u300b\u7684\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6230\u9b25\u6a21\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8f49\u63db\u6210\u5373\u6642\u6230\u9b25\n\u4eba\u683c\u9762\u5177\u30011 MORE\u3001\u62cd\u624b\u63db\u4eba\u3001\u7e3d\u653b\u64ca\u6eff\u6eff\u7684\u90fd\u662f\u300aP5\u300b\u5473\n\u5982\u4eca\u300aP5S\u300b\u767b\u9678PC\u5e73\u53f0\u9084\u662f\u9858\u610f\u518d\u82b1\u9322\u8cb7\u4e00\u6b21\n\u5e0c\u671b\u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\u7684\u300a\u5973\u795e\u7570\u805e\u9304\u300b\u7e8c\u4f5c\u90fd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u767c\u884cPC\u5e73\u53f0", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3ea5932bed765f2e88d2f05d8824ae1d", "author": "6f24930a76105207ac389a3a3309479d", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 6422, "content": "Kawakamiiiiiiiiiiiiii-Sensei I missed you so much....</3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 5, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5ddb328774005feba8b404ad4dc59834", "author": "6daef6de01cb57ceb59681ab12935d11", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 45839, "content": "I like everything about this game", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "edd6518000bd5ce2b26b9f1efd7fd3eb", "author": "6a14c4bd5b445e9da7dfe970de99ac9f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 36, "content": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e00\u76f4\u9ed1\u5c4f\u554a\uff1f\uff1f", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "7acf9dd6505d591a9bc6be1948bbc2b8", "author": "ce5bf21065b95c928729fab5cfd3863e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 6604, "content": "Persona 5-2, thought it was gonna be a Musou game, but instead got a great Action RPG with amazing combat and it is a direct sequel to P5.

If you go in with an open mind you'll be pleasantly surprised with what they've done here. While it won't have a great level of tactical depth as a turn based Persona game, stringing combos together, pausing the action for a moment to bring out your persona and use an ability, it's all very seamless and well done. I'm enjoying the game so far, it really is a bonafide Persona 5 sequel (not Persona 5 Royal sequel). \n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nI am 18 hours in so this is an initial impression. The premise here is fine, we are basically moving themes from corrupt adults doing whatever they want to fulfill their own selfish desire to social media being a bad influence on young adults and making them do awful things to get over their complex and escape the judgement of their peers. Perhaps at the end of this there will be an in-depth commentary on the effect of social media on our collective psyche. It is serviceable enough in retaining attention, however, without going into explicit spoilers, I do find the recycling of some of the motives that compel the phantom thieves to do what they do to be frustrating. \n\n[h1]-Graphics-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Very Stylized \u2705\n    [*]Supports up to 4K \u2705\n    [*]Borderless, full-screen, windowed options \u2705\n    [*]Some text does not scale well at high resolutions \u274c\n    [*]Limited graphical options (bloom, motion blur, AA, AO, textures, shadows) \u274c\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Runs smooth \u2705\n    [*]Potato friendly \u2705\n    [*]Coin toss on if you'll play 4 hours without a single crash or one hour and crash 2 times.

The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 26, "funny": 3, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "15595624b57f56a0aaf292a8d9b034d1", "author": "1906e8df1e285ac192e5b59011d42972", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1881, "content": "First Impressions/Short Review\n\nImagine if Persona 5 was more action oriented and you could pull off all of the action moves you wished you could have done in 5.  That's what Strikers is summed up simply.  It's got all the Persona flavor you know and love and feels like it fits in line as a great sequel.  Confidants have been replaced by Bonds but due to the way this one plays it makes complete sense.  Everything is more streamlined as you can quick travel easily between areas and transitions between screens/zones/The Velvet Room are much faster than 5.\n\nOverall: Still a great amazing game, maybe not as great as Persona 5 unless you prefer action RPG over JRPG in general.

Does it slow down when it needs to? Yes.That said, I keep waiting for this game to become formulaic like its predecessor and it seems to be made specifically to prevent the player from getting complacent. Sure, there's a degree of predictability, but for the most part, it's a fun and unpredictable ride. \n\nWhat I've played of this combined with my experience with Astral Chain leads me to believe that, if Omega Force let themselves out of their own cage more often, they would easily outpace Platinum at their own strengths. Each game of theirs I've played since Dynasty Warriors 8 has begun to diverge further and further from the formula they used to strictly employ and it is completely for the better. Hyrule Warriors: Calamity was pretty good, but...I don't know if Atlus really knew how to draw their potential out of them or if they just were encouraged to just let loose and go wild but holy crap the gameplay feels great.\n\nCouple that with the soundtrack, which the mediocre tracks in this outpace some of the best tracks in the already stellar soundtrack Persona 5 had and you have a mixture for a game that frequently just hits the damn zenith for what an action game can make the player feel.\n\nAll that said, the game doesn't forget the series it's in. Many have said it's a love letter to fans of the series and it feels exactly like that. The plot builds on the characters they spent over 100 hours feeding us backstory and introducing to us, and Strikers serves to just show us how all of them have grown, both individually and as a group of friends who haven't seen each other for a year, but still kept in touch.\n\nI could honestly go on longer but I think the point is made, and I'd rather not spoil anything.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ad3fc7f0d1355bd5984101a31a01be5f", "author": "3919e5213f5e595da8f80580d2e4a8d1", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2739, "content": "[i]Persona 5 Strikers setzt in den Sommerferien nach der Geschichte von Persona 5 an und ist damit im Grunde eine Fortsetzung von Persona 5. W\u00e4hrend Persona 5 allerdings, wie die anderen Persona-Hauptteile, ein rundenbasiertes Rollenspiel mit Social-Elementen ist, ist P5S im Kern ein Action-Spiel. Das Kampfsystem und die Dungeon-Teile des Spiels laufen also ab wie in Teilen der \"Warriors\"-Serie mit hektischen K\u00e4mpfen gegen Massen von Gegnern.[/i]\n\n\n[b]tl;dr: Wem Persona 5 gefallen hat, der sollte auch P5S auf jeden Fall eine Chance geben.[/b]\n\n\nIch bin kein Fan von Musou- bzw. den \"Warriors\"-Spielen. Einige habe ich versucht, nach dem man ein-zwei Mal in eine Gegnermenge gepr\u00fcgelt hat, wurde das ganze dann aber auch recht trocken. Das ist bei Persona 5 Strikers anders, vor allem, weil sich Strikers immer noch vorrangig nach Persona anf\u00fchlt. Zumindest in den ersten 15 Stunden, die ich jetzt hinter mir habe. Kommt man dr\u00fcber hinweg, dass die K\u00e4mpfe jetzt deutlich hektischer ablaufen, die Infiltrationen sich zeitweise etwas gestreckt anf\u00fchlen und man sich dieses Mal keinen Waifu-Harem errichten kann, wird Persona 5 eigentlich in so ziemlich allem solide fortgesetzt. Das neue Setting ist cool, es gibt eine Menge alte und neue Orte zu entdecken, die Dialoge sind super und der Soundtrack ist der Hammer.\n\n\n[b]Contra[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Man kann keine Freundschaften mehr aus- und aufbauen, wodurch Abwechselung verloren geht. Entweder man k\u00e4mpft, man bereitet sich auf K\u00e4mpfe vor oder es geht in der Story weiter.\n[*]Die Infiltrationen bauen oft auf Fetch-Quests (Sammle drei X, um dieses Tor zu \u00f6ffnen!) auf, was das ganze ziemlich entschleunigt.\n[*]Einige Abschnitte, wo man f\u00fcr X Minuten ein wehrloses Teammitglied vor Gegnerhorden besch\u00fctzen muss. Gibt es irgendjemanden, der sowas gerne macht?\n[*]Die K\u00e4mpfe ziemlich un\u00fcbersichtlich. Das wird an meiner Abneigung gegen Musou liegen, aber das Geschehen im Blick zu behalten w\u00e4hrend man 150 Shadows in alle Richtungen drischt, ist eine Leistung f\u00fcr sich.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Pro[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Die Phantom Thieves sind wieder zusammen! Die Gruppendynamik hat kein St\u00fcck verloren. Es macht Spa\u00df, mit den Teammitgliedern zu quatschen und ihnen zuzuh\u00f6ren.\n[*]Die neue Story und das Setting sind klasse. Man kommt an eine Menge neuer Orte und das Geschehen kn\u00fcpft gut an P5 an.\n[*]Jeder der Phantom Thieves ist (in den Dungeons) spielbar und hat eigene F\u00e4higkeiten. Wer nicht mit Joker rumrennen will, wechselt einfach zu jemand anderem.\n[*]Man kann Makoto spielen\n[*]Auch wenn die K\u00e4mpfe nicht meins sind, man hat so viel wie m\u00f6glich von den Mechaniken aus Persona 5 darin untergebracht, was das Ganze deutlich ertr\u00e4glicher macht. Auch das Fusionieren und Einsetzen unterschiedlicher Personas wurde ziemlich gut untergebracht\n[*]Der Soundtrack hat neue Songs sowie neue Versionen alter Songs und ist einfach gut.\n[*]Grafisch sieht das Spiel genauso gut aus wie P5\n[/list]", "comments": 5, "source": "steam", "helpful": 30, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "d49fc173aab453d1abffe99def1d2c28", "author": "8eed6dd010315622bdbb779118c32644", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 6070, "content": "A great sequel to one of the most impactful storylines i've experienced in a game.

PLEASE for the love of god wait for a patch. Now that I've been playing for longer the more and more issues I've been having with the pc version. It crashes often, leading me to lose progress, I've lost around 4 hours of progress in total which has been extremely infuriating. [b][EDIT: This issue has been resolved in the latest beta hotfix][/b]Performance has had dips, while not constant they're noticeable. The settings that come with the game do almost nothing, so i had to go into Nvidia control panel to make AA myself. At this point I cannot progress through one of the last jails because of a loading screen that makes my game crash each time. I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.", "comments": 4, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b39307a6367051d79bb48b6e452f718c", "author": "6fee4577c0595c9aa93ad2b2ac411f6f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5317, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers \u00e9 incr\u00edvel. N\u00e3o deixa nada a desejar em quest\u00e3o de hist\u00f3ria nos padr\u00f5es de jogos da ATLUS. \u00c9 um \u00f3timo reencontro com os personagens de Persona 5 em uma nova aventura percorrendo o metaverso da psicologia junguiana com um objetivo novo, de ir atr\u00e1s de Desejos ao inv\u00e9s de Tesouros, percorrendo Pris\u00f5es ao inv\u00e9s de Pal\u00e1cios.\nStrikers se passa ap\u00f3s o final do P5, por isso, recomendo jogar o Persona 5 antes de Persona 5 Strikers (ou assistir um playthrough, j\u00e1 que ainda n\u00e3o existe P5 pra pc), por causa de algumas refer\u00eancias que o jogo acaba n\u00e3o explicando e para voc\u00ea se familiarizar com os personagens. \nA gameplay de batalha \u00e9 bem diferente do cl\u00e1ssico J-RPG e um pouco dif\u00edcil de pegar o jeito no come\u00e7o.

Por conta disso, creio que fizeram um bom trabalho ao criar um jeito de colocar Persona dentro do g\u00eanero Musou mantendo toda a ess\u00eancia do estilo padr\u00e3o do game.\n\nAh sim, antes que eu esque\u00e7a de mencionar, os personagens novos me agradaram demais:\nZenkichi \u00e9 mais um personagem do tipo investigador, que \u00e9 um elo entre os phantom thieves e a pol\u00edcia.

Atlus should port that next to be fair. With that said:\n\nIf you're a Persona fan considering skipping this game because:\n\n1)It's not \"real Persona/Megaten\"\n2)It's not turn-based\n3)There is no Social Link/Dating mechanic\n4)It's not The Royal (Although please do not play this before at least vanilla P5)\n\n\nPLEASE reconsider. This is in every sense still a very Persona game.\n\n\nTo say this is not true Persona is the equivalent of saying Persona is not true SMT. They are in the same family and are loyal to the spirit of the series. P1 and P2 did not have social link too.\n\n\nTrust me when I say Atlus has gone to great lengths to ensure this game FEELS like a sequel to Persona 5.\n\n\nThis game is missing some elements which might disappoint Persona fans:\n\n-There is no social link/confidant\n-Persona fusions are extremely streamlined\n-The combat is (obviously) not turn-based\n-The calendar system is fully controlled by plot, nothing actually passes time\n-SP depletes SUPER fast in the early game, but after a couple dozen hours I've begun to appreciate spreading out skills cleverly with normal attacks and combos. Leaving the dungeon to regenerate has no time penalty but is a bit of a time waster, should just have an option to skip the animation entirely tbh\n\n\nDESPITE THIS:\n\n-There's an abundance of \"social-like\" events and cutscenes, they're just integrated into the plot\n-Some are actually optional and are nice breathers very loyal to Persona fashion. Some of these are also in the form of requests/sidequests.\n-There's also a Confidant-like system that applies only to the Phantom Thieves. It's mostly automatic but there are actions you can take to increase the rank further. Rather than 10 ranks with set bonuses, you gain points to invest in skills of your choosing\n-The Palaces (or \"Jails\") are pretty well designed from what I have played of them and are much longer compared to P5 to compensate for the shorter calendar. They are HUGE. Plenty of verticality in some parts and nice platforming.\n-Yes it's simplified, but fusions are still pretty fun and skill inheritance plays a role\n-BUFFS, buffs are still important in this game. If you're skilled you can chip away at bosses with low level.\n-The combat is very flexible to your playstyle. A well prepared player can just use Persona skills, which stop time, and continually spam skills as if they were just playing a regular Persona game. You can also just stick to realtime and continually chain combos.\n-Being able to control all Phantom Thieves and swapping between them in combos feels great\n-There are many more areas to explore since this game covers a road trip, incuding P5's Shibuya\n-Early parts of each Jail kinda feel like Persona 4's Intel gathering segments, but here there's a percentage on screen so you know when there's actual progress (less guessing)\n\nIn the 4 days of early access (Pre-Order) I've had 2 crashes to desktop after a cutscene. It was very random and I barely had any other issue.\n\nTips (You can probably ignore this if you wanna go 100% blind but there's no story mentioned here):\n\n-FPS has 2 settings, 30 and 60fps, I believe you cannot unlock this.\n-If your computer can handle it, set the resolution scale to 2.0x or at least 1.5x. At 1.0 the game's antialiasing is nearly non-existant.\n-Use the tutorials menu! It's the only place you'll learn combos and they're **CRUCIAL**\n-Shops restock based on plot and battles too, not just the calendar! Always check when you return from the metaverse AND make sure you know what shops have what so you don't waste yen. (YES even the vending machine trash is VERY IMPORTANT in this game, mostly early tho)\n-Just like items are important, don't ignore cooking. It's very good.\n-Use BOND skillpoints wisely. Money and Shop Sale are very good, but all of them matter.\n-Upgrading the shop sale BOND skill will restock the shop, use this very wisely!\n-Revisiting Jails has value as the requests system makes a return", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 7, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c161f6f45f015888bbd22f572b48ae2a", "author": "fe173f369e7152af89f3e3a6d9b2939f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3365, "content": "i can skateboard as morgana 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9f5721b77ecc5a5daf6f7ba8c1bbb746", "author": "ff11d210231251d6953057dd57f4659c", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 625, "content": "where's adachi", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "63cc1ce351455f079c1e35ece85c0085", "author": "4903e8e3b7675e4480efad8bdcb45171", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3704, "content": "I love this game and I really enjoy playing it.\nNow i just hope to play Persona 5 Royal once more on PC in 4k 60fps in the future.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 19, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "dea4c4ff42bd51d6aa135d3bfeabb653", "author": "119825d9da275e5abd197a8284607222", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2509, "content": "It gets quite repetitive with not much to change it up.

This entail huge battles and being overloaded by enemies. I love the combat and I strongly recommend this games to fans of the series or fans of action games.\n\nA caveat to this is that, it's a sequel. The game is 100% enjoyable if its you're first persona game or you've only played persona 4 Golden. It does have major plot spoilers to Persona 5.\n\nA problem that the game suffers from is it is locked at 60FPS.

Spin-offs are bad, at least as a general rule. And then, along came Persona 5 Strikers, which serves as much of a spin-off as a sequel. It is by no means a perfect game, no game is perfect, but this is goddam near it. Atlus could have re-skinned a warriors game whit Persona, and i would have bought it. Instead, what i got was a love letter to both, the Phantom Thieves and the Players. \n\nThis carries over a great deal of Persona 5. While some elements are shaved due to mechanics, most of them evolved with the gameplay change. Confidants are replaced by a bond system, you generate bond points trough certain requests or by fighting along characters. As expected the buffs from bonds are geared towards action games, more damage, faster bond growth, etc. At the same time this serves as a much friendlier system to the player, while still advances the narrative and deepens the bond between characters with the random personal request.\nAll the over the top action and showtimes are still present, and i must say, they are one of my favorite animations from the game, Atlus really brought out the personality of each Phantom Thieve trough this silly little animations. The combat itself feels fluid and gratifying, if at times a bit repetitive killing random trash. But where the game really shines is trough their boss fights. This has one of my favorite Boss encounters of the saga, and i thought it was nearly impossible to beat Futaba's Palace Boss. It could still use a bit more information on screen, like the direction and the type of incoming attacks from outside the screen, but it is by no means a deal breaker.\n\nThe downside to this game is, if you have not played Persona 5 OG you will probably feel left out on most of the conversations. A lot of references and inside jokes are beautiful winks to veterans of the saga, but might flew over the head of those not familiar with the lore, and i must say, this might lower your enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall i will say, give this game a change if you are a fan of Persona 5, if you haven't played Persona 5 yet, i will still recommend buying this one, as it is a very good warriors like game, and despite the random reference you might miss, the game does a very good job at exploring the characters and the narrative is A+ as i have come to expect from Atlus.\n\nPros\n\n++Combat is fluid and rewarding\n++Graphics are BEAUTIFUL\n++4k 60fps\n++Controls are very good and have a variety of schemes\n++More P5 and Phantom Thieves\n++Story Rich as any other Persona/Shin Megami\n\nCons\n\n--Heavy loaded with references and inside jokes (not necessary to enjoy the game, but you do miss some of the enjoyment)\n--No TIa Takemi ( SRSLY NGGS where is ma TIA)\n--Somewhat short (about 40-50ish hours depending on how fast you rush it)\n--No costumes DLC (yes for this game, that is a Con, trust me on this one)\n\nAll in all, if you are a P5 fan this is a 9/10, if you are not, this is easy an 8/10.

Wenn Du Dich fragst ob dieses Spiel was f\u00fcr Dich ist m\u00f6chte ich vorweg nehmen das die Antwort in jedem Fall Ja lautet.\nOk differenzieren wir etwas. Wenn Du, wie ich Fan der Persona Reihe bist und auch Persona 5 schon gespielt hast, wirst Du Strikers zumindest m\u00f6gen. Das Kampfsystem ist leider anders \nals man es bei P5 gewohnt ist. Was mich angeht ist Persona 5 Royal auf jedenfall eines der besten Spiele aller Zeiten. Kampfsystem, Story, alles passt peferkt. Die Story bei Strikers\nmachte mir auch wirklich viel Spass, das Kampfsystem ist zumindest ok und f\u00fcr Menschen wie mich l\u00e4sst sich das Spiel auf Einfach stellen was die K\u00e4mpfe weiter in den Hintergrund r\u00fccken l\u00e4sst. \nF\u00fcr mich als totaler Persona Fanboy (ist man mit fast 50 noch als Boy zu bezeichnen?^^) war \nes gar keine Frage ob ich Strikers spielen m\u00f6chte (danke an dieser Stelle nochmal an Micha, der mir das Spiel zu Weihnachten schon geschenkt hat ;3) Ich hab in P5 und Royal zusammen gut 300 Stunden gesteckt und werde Royal noch sicher mindestens zweimal durchspielen. \nHat Strikers das Potenzial auch ? Ich bef\u00fcrchte nicht, aber denoch ist Strikers ein sehr gutes \nSpiel das ich jedem Persona Fan ohne Bedenken ans Herz legen kann. \n\nWie oft betitelt f\u00fchlt sich Strikers auch nicht wie ein Spin Off an sondern wie eine waschechte Fortsetzung und allein deswegen ist dies Spiel ein Pflichtprogramm f\u00fcr jeden Fan.\n\nUnd wenn Ich Persona noch gar nicht kenne ? Ja Strikers wirft Dich direkt ins Geschehen und geht davon aus das Du Persona 5 kennst. Ich w\u00fcrde zumindest empfehlen mir kurz einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Story verschaffen. Dies YT Video bietet in 3 Minuten einen gaaaanz groben \u00dcberblick \n(Der Youtube Link wird immer als sch\u00e4dlich angezeigt. Wenn Ihr die Zusammenfassung sehen m\u00f6chtet such in YT nach: Persona 5 FULL GAME RECAP in 3 Minutes!) \n\nAber trotzdem ist man nach einer kurzen Findungsphase im Spiel und wird klar kommen. \nSpass wird IMHO jeder an Strikers haben der diesem Genre nicht ganz abgeneigt sind. \n\nAlso, wir sehen uns in Shibuja :-)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3233148414a15d43b019cc615bf1240b", "author": "43903868215a5613babd022921f95297", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1456, "content": "\u6253\u5b8c\u8537\u7136\u540e\u5c31\u9ed1\u5c4f\u4e86\uff0c\u5c3d\u5feb\u4fee\u590d\u5427", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3ec1fc9910d259a6b03adc8ceb9cfd25", "author": "65eeb85dbb495b0c8a4699229497eb96", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3461, "content": "fight shadow. life good.\n\nshadow fight back!\n\nkill shadow!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fc972a6e989850eb86447696fa9216ae", "author": "441b3402d88c570bb17aa34c1e8702db", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 249, "content": "\u5929\uff01\u4e0b\uff01\u7b2c\uff01\u4e00\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4ba51dd5fd8d561291ade8db051b2c66", "author": "39dbb78f43e056a6a522507dfeb782d4", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3452, "content": "Fun game> I'll give a full review after I beat it.\nSophia best girl.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "47d6e196f66f579699f47223b1a6ad2a", "author": "46823a47e0f75771bc8d69cd9e27397e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2038, "content": "Whoa, I played the demo of the Japanese demo while back, and it felt rough but i personally was excited.

Its not Horrible but if you need to get outta there, and there's a story boss or need to take an enemy out so you can get to the checkpoint it can be nerve racking, and there isn't a lot of sp items.. but its all manageable with enough skill and yeah its still addicting.. and i'm almost done yeah i'm almost done the game i think.. so its also short but still very VERY fun pick the game up, steal hearts again and if you have anyway to play the original game (PLAY THAT FIRST PLEASE IF YOU CAN) play it and play this, i hope we can actually get one more game with this cast as i love them a lot and hopefully you will too.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0b77b8a4550b56fb8e3d386eef3abc08", "author": "116fd6f9d506556fb5b7a5c9163c1a2e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4104, "content": "A nice reunion.

Keep in mind that I did not care for the og Persona 5\u2019s story so I had some doubts about this story going in. I thought the story would be bad due to the same reasons I disliked P5\u2019s story, but the things that irked me in this game are different than what irked me in P5. The story is clich\u00e9d up the wazoo. It does, however, plays with some ideas and themes that work very well. It has emotional moments that work well and the story sets out to do what it wants to do. That is be a summer road trip story around Japan with the Phantom Thieves facing a new threat. My problem is that the story plays it SUPER safe. [b]Spoiler:[/b] [spoiler]It\u2019s almost a repeat of og P5\u2019s story, which is a shame.[/spoiler] It\u2019s also very predictable. If you think to yourself \u201cthis person(s) probably the bad guy,\u201d you\u2019re most likely right. It\u2019s very easy to tell where the story is going. Again, it\u2019s not bad. It just has so much missed potential that completely bums me out. \n\nWhatever the case, you NEED to play og P5 before this as the game 100% assumes you know that game through and through already. Hopefully, they release og P5 or P5R so pc players can play that before this.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nNow, THIS I can get behind. Like many, I had some fears going into this game as I felt this game would be yet another mindless Musou game where you spam attacks and win. And while spamming attacks can get you far pretty early on, it won\u2019t carry you much farther. P5 was half a JRPG and half a social sim. This game is 100% an action RPG. Some will be disappointed by the lack of social sim stuff, but I think the non inclusion of it allows for better pacing in the gameplay, and including it wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the type of story and gameplay Strikers is going for. The new BOND system is a simple yet effective alternative to it I believe. The fighting itself lends itself so well to the warriors\u2019 style of combat. Persona elements like weaknesses, technicals, personas, etc mix so well with it. Each character is a joy to control and each one is just different from one other. Each one of them has their own gameplay purpose. The combat is engaging, and constantly asks you to stay on your toes and use the most of your arsenal since not doing so will result in you dying FAST. Try spamming the attack button on bosses or bigger enemies and see how fast you can die. Using weaknesses and technicals as well as knowing what combos to use is key in beating anything in this game.\n\nThe Jails (which are similar to palaces to P5) were all fun to explore and it was joy to see just how creative they could get. Seriously, most of them were fun going through, obtaining loot, doing requests (which are fun and rewarding except the ones where you have to go to an area without getting caught fuck those), and beating shadows was a blast. Some of the beginning Jails are a bit too close in structure for my liking, but the game quickly switches it up, so it\u2019s not a big deal. I do, however, feel that the game got a bit too easy at the end due to just how overpowered spamming weakness and technicals can be at times for the smaller fry. I was playing on hard and while it was certainly ballbustingly hard early on due to SP drain, the game got a bit too easy at the end for my liking.  \n\nOther complaints include the lack of gun upgrades. I get the omission of social sim stuff among some other things, but no gun upgrades or customization? Why? That makes no sense since I actually like using guns in this game. Such a weird omission. Furthermore, persona fusing is super basic for seemingly no reason. I don\u2019t understand why they simplified Persona\u2019s robust persona fusing to such a simple state. However, other than the complaints I mentioned, I found the combat overall to be exceptional and constantly engaging. \n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n\nThe writing in Strikers is incredible, yet so fucking bad. This game got many laughs out of me and made me feel a lot. Likewise, the writing for the more emotional moments can get a bit too on the nose for my liking, a common problem for Persona, unfortunately. The villain(s) were MOSTLY good in how they went about their way of doing things instead of the one-dimensional cartoonishly evil villains in P5. However, some backstory for some of the villain(s) gets thrown in your face like 20 seconds before fighting them which felt cheap. The main characters (Ryuji, Ann, Haru, Futaba, etc) all remain the great characters they are, but they see little growth in the main story. I mean it\u2019s there, but not enough in my opinion.\n\nNow to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, I love the inclusion of Zenkichi and Sophia. Sophia is an adorable muffin that sees an unbelievable amount of growth in the story. It\u2019s to the point where I consider Sophia to be one of my favorites in all of the Persona series. Zenkichi was amazing as well with a lovable personality and real growth, although not to the extent of Sophia. But they both remain absolutely incredible inclusions to the series.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nIt\u2019s Persona. What do you think? Of course, it\u2019s incredible. The remixes of P5 music as well as the original music in Strikers are all fantastic. [i]Counter Strike[/i] and [i]Daredevil[/i] being personal favs.\n\nHowever, the audio mixing could use some work. The characters become REALLY difficult to hear during boss fights especially with the music is blaring. This can be remedied by messing with the audio levels in the in-game settings, but I hate that this is even an issue.\n\n[b]PC PORT[/b]\n\nWhat a disappointment. Firstly, the positives. The game runs at a stable 60fps all the time. I only ever saw frame drops during cutscenes and the velvet room of all places. Other than that, the performance is solid.\n\nNow for the negatives. This game LOVES to crash. It mainly ever crashed for me during fast travel or loading screens. During my 60 hour journey, I crashed a total of 7 times. [b]7!!![/b] Sometimes I would lose upwards of an hour of progress. Do you know how much it sucks to bust your balls on a difficult boss only for the game to crash afterward without saving? Next, the game options are poor. The game is capped at 60fps. I don\u2019t know if this is an engine issue or if the devs were too lazy to uncap it or what. Furthermore, the game still looks poor. Not the style, mind you (P5 style is still present here in all its glory), but the game doesn\u2019t look enhanced at all for PC. Textures can be muddy and the UI quality REAKS. WHY IS IT SO PIXILATED?! Overall, a pretty disappointing port. Also, RIP mods.\n\nEDIT 03/17/2021: New update has been pushed today that [i]seems[/i] to have fixed or at least remedied the constant crashing. So that's cool.\n\n[b]Closing thoughts[/b]\n\nOverall, my expectations were blown away by this game, as I was expecting not much at all going in. I was expecting a mindless button masher that would give me some kicks based purely on seeing my favorite characters get back together. It is a lot more than that in some parts, and in others not. It\u2019s got its issues. It\u2019s not perfect and some things really drag the game down. However, it does a lot right at the same time. This is a great sequel to P5 and a great, albeit very flawed, game on its own right.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "549e516dad115fafab1aa4a70a68199a", "author": "f0f70860659f5f8688818592e23ae54c", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 493, "content": "I really enjoy the Persona series so when this game was first introduced, I was already intrigued by it.\n\nThe game's story revolves around the life AFTER the original Persona 5 game, so if you haven't played it and care about the story, I would not recommend you to play this game first.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's decent.

I am glad to say it's far more than that. Sure, there are still mindless waves of fodders for you to smash them away, but they also implement tactical RPG stuff really nicely. You will find yourself planning the fight surprisingly a lot more than that. Most systems from Persona series are coming back and fit in really nicely (Elemental weakness, One-more, All-out-attack, Showtime.) It feels not out of place and keep it very true to the lore of Persona 5 in every aspect from gameplay, design, theme, and world's logic.\n\nOne thing that can be see as a downside is P5S is the direct continuation of Persona 5 (with some references to P5R too.) And it's not a small side story but pretty much a full fledged saga. They do try to rush out some of quick recap in the first hour but people without experience of  Persona 5 can find this sudden insertion to technical stuff too absurd for them. Is it needed? Not really. But your reaction would be \"Oh! I remember that! Nice!\" every thirty seconds to \"WTF just happened?\" based on your exposure to Persona franchise. Still a great game, but ATLUS and SEGA should really considered boosting this game with the Persona 5 Royal release on PC.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 3, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4715ea9c7c7e5c72be665ded61966380", "author": "8e5b78981a705222be88e5cc4a85783d", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1917, "content": "Roses are red\nVelvet room is blue\nThe phantom thieves are back\nAnd to kick some a**, there is no better crew", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fbb89b6299f85de4a964c9d9d059ee6a", "author": "2ab59df8db465109a957c007bcb9bc62", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 8, "content": "\u8d76\u7d27\u4e0aP5R\u5427   \u4f60\u6562\u51fa\u6211\u5c31\u6562\u4e70\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 26, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "aa935cdffaf65018b491b0c50182900c", "author": "f1a4750bae3c5a4286c167d9bcd1f88c", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1547, "content": "I never thought my dream came true like this, this is a greenlight for Atlus to release their other games or maybe another future potential IP to release on this platform.

Sequ\u00eancia muito boa pro Persona 5. Problema \u00e9 que em 15h de jogo ja sofri com o game crashando umas 4x.... Sem falar que algumas fun\u00e7\u00f5es de graficos nas op\u00e7\u00f5es literalmente n\u00e3o funcionam, e qualquer resolu\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo de 1080p deixa o jogo horrendo.\n\nN\u00e3o vale 300 reais nem se o jogo nao tivesse esses problemas, mas tendo complica mesmo kkkkkk. Espera uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o e compra. E atlus pelamor de Deus lan\u00e7a o Royal pra PC.\n\nEdit pos primeiro playthrough: O jogo \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, muito bom mesmo. No momento estou na minha segunda jogada na dificuldade Merciless e posso garantir que se voc\u00ea gosta de Persona ou games mussou voc\u00ea vai gostar. Ainda n\u00e3o acho que 300 reais seja justo, mas numa promo\u00e7\u00e3o acho que vale muito apena. N\u00e3o entre no jogo esperando combos complexos a l\u00e1 devil may cry, \u00e9 um action-rpg mussou n\u00e3o um hack n slash. No late game do jogo voc\u00ea vai mais spammar skill e o mesmo combo que usa aquela skill de gra\u00e7a do que qualquer outra coisa kkkkkk. Quanto aos crashs, percebi que (pelo menos no meu caso) eles s\u00e3o isolados nas primeiras dungeons e vou explicar porque acho isso: quando estava no final do meu playthrough, eu joguei literalmente as ultimas 2 dungeons inteiras sem nenhum crash, e assim que comecei minha gameplay no merciless, meu jogo voltou a crashar em Shibuya, n\u00e3o sei porque e \u00f3bvio que isso precisa ser corrigido, mas s\u00f3 de saber que n\u00e3o \u00e9 o game todo cagado ja me da um alivio. Enfim... depois de zerar posso dizer que me diverti muito com ele, que os personagens novos s\u00e3o uns fofos (zenkichi ja \u00e9 meu personagem favorito da franquia) e que o game apesar dos problemas t\u00e9cnicos \u00e9 sim divertido", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 100, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a0144cdc34365adea3ab091ad103b5d9", "author": "7e79a5a187db5e259590db28f57e4474", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 69, "content": "[b] \u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e04\u0e48\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e01\u0e48\u0e32\u0e46\u0e01\u0e47\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 [/b]\n\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e43\u0e08\u0e01\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e20\u0e32\u0e04\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e19\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e21\u0e39\u0e42\u0e0b \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e07\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e19\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e15\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\n\n\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e34\u0e48\u0e21\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e30\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01\u0e04\u0e19\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e21 \n\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1f\u0e19Persona5 ...[b] Phantom Thieves \u0e01\u0e33\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e01\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e21\u0e32 [/b]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3ba88d9d6db5524aa886778a7203bb45", "author": "2e0d6a09c68054e2a087c09392a6ce42", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4083, "content": "If you liked Persona 5 and simply want more then its a great follow up.

But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus ! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker!

You and Morgana returned to Tokyo for your summer vacation, after planning for a barbecue with your friends, you were suddenly thrown into the Metaverse once more...\n---\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat is a combination of both Warriors-series by Omega Force and Persona-series, although it's a lot more similar to \"Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon\", with the fluidity and mobility of \"Warriors\" combat. You'll still primarily press a series of buttons to execute your attacks and strong attacks, however, you can also pause in-combat to use your Persona skills or recovery items.\nEach character, Persona, and enemy have their own kit, strength, and weaknesses. The way abilities are used by enemies will vary for each type of enemy, for example, Mara's \"One-Shot Kill\" would send a barrage of bullets towards the enemy (and 'stains' you for some reason), while Seth's \"One Shot Kill\" would be an explosion. This variation makes for a unique encounter for each enemy. You can obtain Personas by defeating them in the battlefield, or by fusing two (or more) Personas in the Velvet Room.\nThe hack-and-slash gameplay is vastly different than in other Warriors games. Each enemy will also have a \"Knockdown Gauge\" which, if depleted, will knock them down and enables \"1 More\" move and/or \"All-Out Attack\" for the player. You can deplete the gauge by dealing critical hits or striking the enemies' weaknesses. If the enemy still has \"Knockdown Gauge\", they won't stagger at all by your normal attacks, which lets them to counter your attacks by using abilities.\nYou can play as one of four characters that you choose before delving into a dungeon. Each character is actually fun to play, and each of them has certain characteristics in their movesets which are unique to them, which makes for a fun, different playstyle for each character -- something that is missing from modern Warriors games.\n-----\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAh, the story. Before the story starts, there was an phenomenon called the \"Change of Hearts\" epidemic in which some high-profile figures confessed to many scandals, the authorities ruled out the possibility that the Phantom Thieves are the perpetrator behind this phenomenon and started an investigation against them.\nBack to Joker and friends. After planning for a barbecue, they downloaded an app called EMMA, an artificial intelligence guide, which also doubles as an SNS app in which users can become friends with each other by sharing their \"keywords\". Turns out, some keywords will send people's Shadows to Jails within the Metaverse. With the Metaverse's return, Joker and the Phantom Thieves set out to solve the mystery behind it. Along the way, they were informed by a member of the authorities that the same phenomenon is currently happening in Sapporo, and the said member also asked the assistance of the Phantom Thieves to solve the case.\nThe Phantom Thieves decided that they would spend their summer vacation solving the mystery of the Jails and the Metaverse, while also having a road trip across various cities in Japan.\n---\nThe story is a generic slice-of-life anime story with a pinch of \"Shin Megami Tensei\", typical Persona games. The 3D cutscenes and incredible voice acting makes the story interesting enough for me, that I can endure a 40 minute-long series of cutscenes.\nBottom line, the story is pretty good, but the duration of the cutscenes are probably too long for some people.\n-----\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nIf you played both Warriors and Persona games, then you'll want to cross Easy and Normal out of your choices. Hard difficulty offers a tough but fair combat, and you'll risk of actually losing the battle.\nAfter you beat the game and beat the ultimate boss, you'll unlock a new difficulty for New Game+ called \"Merciless\". This difficulty will crank enemy status through the roof, even early Shadows like Pixies and Jack o' Lanterns will easily kill you. Hell, the tutorial Bicorn feels like Chaos-Lu Bu where you can be killed in two hits -- even if you're level 82 with high-tier Personas.\nSo yeah, go with Hard mode for the first playthrough, and choose Merciless for the second playthrough. At least you won't be too surprised by the difficulty jump in New Game+.\n-----\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nCrashes. I experienced more than 12 crashes in my first playthrough, it often happens after leaving the Velvet Room, whenever cutscene background changing drastically (for example, from inside LeBlanc to outside LeBlanc), and leaving dungeons. Some even happen in the middle of a series of cutscenes after a 10 minutes boss fight. I really hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else.\n------\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI had fun playing this game, 54 hours of hack-and-slash-plus-JRPG fun accompanied by an interesting and entertaining story -- makes for a game I would easily recommend to anyone. I hope that I can see another Strikers game again from Atlus and Omega Force.\n-----\nThat being said, please port Persona 5 Royal to PC, Atlus.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0,

Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.\n\n[h1]Some After Thought[/h1]\nWhat I said above is all true, this game is still a fantastic game and I urge anyone who interested in this game to play. HOWEVER, this game-by all means-still is not a traditional Persona experience. I still recommend mainline Persona more than this game overall. And since this is a beat 'em up game and this is a linear-story game, the replay-ability is next to none apart from the completionist gamer. So for me, the flaws of this game is really \"It's not normal Persona\" which is dumb. ATLUS did a thing that throw us off, and they done a fantastic job.

I had multiple crashes and consistent freezes when zoning into one of the dungeons which needed to be waited out to continue. I was more than willing to overlook these issues and power through as the game is just really good and hard to put down.\n\nIf you haven't played Persona 5 However I would recommend holding off on playing this until you have. (Hopefully Persona 5 sees a Steam release at some point. Please Sega) The story does very little to explain what happened in the previous game as it presumes you already know the events. Which is a good and bad things as this doesn't really spoil the story of the original too much if you were to play this first, but might leave Strikers only players confused about what/who is being referenced at times. \n\nThis is a must play for Persona 5 players and for everyone else play both.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "16ab7eb59f2d52ac8d95ceea8421114b", "author": "9a2f20a79d0f5af79e64b43fe234f739", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2345, "content": "\u6ca1\u6709\u5b66\u59b9\u548c\u4e00\u4e8c\u4e09\uff0c\u6211\u4e0a\u5f53\u4e86\n\u6211\u88c5\u7684\uff0c\u5468\u53ef\u624d\u662f\u6c38\u8fdc\u7684\u8001\u5a46", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "f73d8f285048530d911687a8abb24611", "author": "42bbfc4ab7035e7981958bc8d34c51ee", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3219, "content": "this game is amazing, im really enjoying it! \nbut it will be very hard to understand it,without playing the persona 5 original.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "724695541d5153ff8477be519a4faa20", "author": "fc41f086207151dca4774cec819b0453", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4477, "content": "After some tweaking, the game runs real fine on my 4th gen i7 & GTX 950m laptop.

me ha sorprendido para bien, combinando el concepto de estos de los combates con muchos enemigos en pantalla de manera simult\u00e1nea con los elementos t\u00edpicos de combate de la saga Persona adaptados a un combate en tiempo real.\n\nSi tuviera que decir algo que echo de menos es la gesti\u00f3n de tiempo t\u00edpica de la saga, aunque viendo c\u00f3mo se desarrolla el juego es algo que entiendo, debido a que al contrario que en otros juegos de Persona es una historia que se desarrolla en mucho menos tiempo, aparte que no hay fechas l\u00edmite como en otros juegos, as\u00ed que perder\u00eda el sentido la gesti\u00f3n de dicho tiempo.\n\nRespecto a los propios Persona, noto que hay menos que en un juego principal, pero no pocos. Comprensible, ya que aqui conseguir uno es tan simple como matarlo y tener suerte de que suelte la m\u00e1scara, probabilidad que puedes aumentar con los puntos de relaci\u00f3n que hay en el juego, no hay que negociar ni nada como en P5 o elegir una carta como en P4, y como no hay gesti\u00f3n del tiempo, con farmear en una zona puedes conseguir personas de sobra para fusionar o tener.\n\nYendo a la historia y personajes, la idea de las c\u00e1rceles innova al dar algo similar a c\u00f3mo funcionaban los palacios en el juego original pero adapt\u00e1ndolo a las nuevas mec\u00e1nicas de este y dando una nueva vuelta de tuerca a las ideas del mundo cognitivo que se presentaban en el P5. Los personajes antiguos siguen siendo igual que buenos que en el P5, y los nuevos encajan perfectamente, tanto los nuevos integrantes del grupo como los monarcas de las c\u00e1rceles y distintos personajes que van apareciendo.\n\nLa banda sonora es como siempre buen\u00edsima, y si compras la versi\u00f3n Deluxe como en mi caso, aunque es una tonter\u00eda,  puedes jugar con las OST de batalla de los otros juegos de Persona, lo cual si te gustaron los juegos o su banda sonora, pues es un detalle extra que est\u00e1 bastante bien.\n\nComo opini\u00f3n final, aunque por el momento solo llevo 12 horas jugadas, me parece un buen juego, muy entretenido para los que hayan jugado al Persona 5, y para los que no tambi\u00e9n, aunque en ese caso te pierdes bastantes detalles del mismo al ser una secuela, ya que el juego da por hecho que jugaste al anterior y muchas conversaciones, din\u00e1micas de personajes \n y temas de la historia principal vienen del juego anterior.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 35, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "bbc3ce089d6a5428895f061bd3771b69", "author": "1d288d8364145a36b007a674401c54b5", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2984, "content": "TLDR : A Refreshing take on the Persona franchise that actually works pretty well, with a few hiccups here and there. A solid game despite the lack of it's predecessor, P5 being on Steam (GIVE US P5R ON PC ATLUS / SEGA!) \n\nFull Review :\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes the traditional turn based combat gameplay of Persona and actually manages to make a pretty good hack'n'slash adaptation of it. Persona skills and all work well within a real-time environment, and you even have the ability to string them into combos for no SP cost too (SP is basically the \"mana\" of Persona, for the newcomers). \n\nThe game does have one major flaw though in it's execution, the lack of the social aspect of Persona. In the mainline Modern Persona games (Persona 3 FES / P3 Portable / Persona 4 Golden (it's on Steam too go buy it) / Persona 5 / P5R) you have a big focus on the social side of gameplay, interacting with your companions, potential romance options, etc., which tie into the dungeon crawling aspect of them by strengthening companions you have strong bonds too. None of that is present in Strikers here, which is a shame. \n\nStrikers is also much more linear than the mainline games. That's not to say the mainline games I'm comparing it too had multiple endings or anything (P4 had like 7, P5R had 4 or so if I remember right), but they had a TON of stuff mixed into the social side, such as choosing whether to go out with friends (strengthen bonds) or do something to strengthen your own stats on a specific day. Speaking of days, in Strikers there isn't any time progression outside of story events, so unlike in the main games, there's nothing really pressuring you to pick and choose things, so you can basically just sit and grind if you want, which, admittedly works well for Strikers gameplay wise, but still worth noting the difference there. \n\nThe game also lacks a lot of the Personas from 3-5 too, there's a lot, don't get me wrong, just MUCH more in the main games, though I'm not counting it as a negative thing, still plenty to choose from and you can easily use the Persona Points system (unique to Strikers, not in earlier games) and the accumulated power system to strengthen your favorite Personas. That plus the fusion system which is a Persona mainstay allow for you to easily take that level 5 weak Persona and turn him into a 99-Stat monster. \n\nThe dungeons are also different here as well, they're much more open than the ones in Persona 3, 4 and 5, while keeping the similar style that dungeons in Persona 5 had. This is mostly due to the combat being you and the Phantom Thieves against a horde of shadows every time, but it works. \n\nOverall it's pretty great. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal (or the base Persona 5) you may be somewhat lost with the terms and world of the game, but outside of the story of the Phantom Thieves and the Metaverse, you can still have a good time and know the basics. The story isn't as good as the mainline games either, likely due to it being shorter and more condensed (40 hours in Strikers vs. 100 hours in Persona 4 Golden or 150 in P5 Royal). \n\nAlso, if you're wondering about the DLC under the game, ignore the All Out Attack Pack, but definitely go and buy the legacy BGM pack, as it includes battle themes from every mainline Persona games, even the old 1990s Persona 1 and 2 that nobody remembers. It also includes the very popular themes from P3, P3P, P4, and P4G, that is to say\n\n- A Lone Prayer (Persona 1)\n-Mass Destruction (Persona 3)\n-Wiping All Out (Persona 3 Portable, from the Female Main Character's Route in that game)\n- Reach out To the Truth (Persona 4)\n- Time to Make History (Persona 4 Golden) \n\nYou actually also get the themes from Persona 5  and Persona 5 Royal IN THE BASE GAME WITHOUT DLC, you just have to beat the main story and get a game cleared save file to get access to them, but the base game does come with a pretty awesome rock remix of Last Surprise (P5's theme) in the base game before then, it's pretty neat. \n\nI'd like to end this review by engaging in the time honored tradition of port-begging\n*ahem*\n\nPLEASE ATLUS / SEGA GIVE US PERSONA 3 FES and PERSONA 5 ROYAL!\n\nThank you for reading this review and I hope it helped.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName":

another IP, but it's probably the most unique. It makes you feel like playing a hack-and-slash warriors game with all the action RPG flare in it, but also a Persona/Shin Megami Tensei game with world map exploration and tactical battles. It's not a war game but an expanded take on Atlus' formula that feels the best of both worlds.\n\nThe story: Six months after the Phantom Thieves' greatest heist, the team gets back together for summer vacation. They get help to prepare from a super AI phone app known as EMMA, which supposedly can know all about user preferences and what you want/need to shop and where. But during a routine shopping trip and a run-in with an overly popular idol, Joker, Mona and Skull find themselves suddenly thrown into the Metaverse once more. As they escape, they discover an odd girl who introduces herself as Sophie, humanity's companion, who quickly lends their aid to the thieves. The team decides to cut vacation plans short as they get to the bottom of this situation, but things are worse than they appear. Inspector Zenkichi from Public Security warns the thieves that there are similar problems happening all over the country, and that Joker's the number one suspect of all the \"changed hearts\" happening. Not only must they clear their name, but prepare for another ominous calamity on the horizon.\n\nStrikers is mostly for Persona 5 fans though as it'll jump in expecting you to mostly know what happened in the previous game (and that's vanilla form; no mention of \"Kasumi\" from Royale here). They do bring up references from the prequel whenever it feels necessary, whether it's to explain the new \"Jails\" work or bringing their newest member Sophie up to speed. There's even a clever interface where first registering EMMA you can put in the main protagonist (Joker)'s real name, as well as setting up other game options from voice overs to difficulty.\n\nIt definitely feels like a sequel and not that out of place from the previous entry. Unlike other Persona spin-offs that while having fun premises were very jarring and different from turn-based gameplay. A musou action RPG feels a more organic take-off than say, a 2-D fighter (Persona 4 Arena) or rhythm game (Dancing All Night, Dancing in Starlight, Dancing in Moonlight). It also feels more of a continuation to the story than fanservice for fanservices' sake, like with Arena or Q-Q2.\n\nBack to gameplay, you have your options to attack with a melee weapon, shoot with a gun, or use a Persona spell for advantages. What's new is that you can also access a \"special\" command, which is kind of rudimentary in musou games like this. If the melee attack is your light attack, then the special is your heavy, and using any combination of these buttons can string combos for better results than just mashing attack over and over. In some cases, the combos allow you to use a Persona's elemental attack without using up SP and striking their weaknesses for extra damage. Every character plays different and feel more than just gated by their stats and elements. For example, Joker is nimble and balanced with his attacks flowing very quickly and his specials having the potential to change up based on what Persona he equips.\n\nJoker is the only character who can collect and use different Personas that you face in the game as Shadows, which is benefited by entering the Velvet Room. Compared to examples in the original games, the Velvet Room feels more user friendly in that you don't have to worry about confidant links to power up through levels; you can power level them yourself and consistently as you collect Power Points from mask drops. You can even increase the level of your starter Persona, Arsene. Unlike most other Personas you collect, he gets new skills that scale up as he gets stronger. However, each level up costs significantly more points, and Persona level ups have fixed stats instead of 3 at random. Some increase all across the board (Strength, Endurance, Agility, Magic, Luck), some don't increase at all. Leveling Personas up makes transferring skills when you fuse feel easier, and instead of a complicated math program that determines what arcana/level between personas, they have predetermined fusions. On the plus side, when you resummon Personas to use, they stay the same and the cost doesn't scale up from their level, no matter how many times you register (save) their levels and spell list in the compendium. \n\nThe game is very linear, and there's no rush to clear things in time unlike the prequel. You sadly won't see much of the supporting cast (Takemi and Iwai had their stores closed for the summer, for example, forcing you to rely on Sophie for shopping needs). But that means you won't suffer many time crunching consequences regardless of difficulty. You can buy all the items at vending machines/stores in the hub world, travel through a Jail for hours at end, grinding for money and treasure, then leave. The stores will restock to buy again, and the characters HP/SP will have restored to max reflecting their new earned levels. Time will move forward when you progress with the story, usually by accomplishing an intel task or fighting a checkpoint boss. You are free to take your time in the game, no worries. \n\nSound is finicky at parts, as I swear I feel the mic for Ryuji/Skull's lines trail off as he mumbles his script. Music is mostly recycled from the previous game (or games if you got the digital bundle and get the option to change what battle music plays from across the Persona series). There seem to be only a few new songs, being Jail and overmap related. There are also remixes such as \"Blooming Villain\" that sound like a fitting theme for Lu Bu were he in this game. The character models look as great as they did in the prequel, and while there might be some off putting textures to some, I didn't notice a problem. Maybe it's because PC is running better than PS4 or Switch these days.\n\nIn the end, Persona 5 Strikers is a very solid game.

Mantiene la esencia de Persona y se atreve a ir un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 con combates con base musou pero profundidad similar a Final Fantasy VII Remake.\n\nPuntos negativos: Mis \u00fanicas quejas ser\u00edan el que la m\u00fasica extra de otros juegos de Persona sea un DLC aparte, y que comprar objetos en las tiendas sean tan caro para el poco dinero que ganas al principio. Tampoco entiendo el tener que pasar por dos pantallas de carga para recuperar toda la vida y estamina, ya que si el juego no iba a penalizar abandonar una mazmorra cuando queramos, podr\u00edamos haber tenido la opci\u00f3n de recuperarnos en un punto de control.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nM\u00e1s Persona de lo que pueda parecer a simple vista.\n\nEs 100% seguro que v\u00e1is a ver los tr\u00e1ilers y gameplays y pensar que esto es un musou con elementos de Persona 5 para machacar botones y hacer mil cosas en pantalla y ya, pero desde ya puedo decir que no es as\u00ed.\n\nLa historia se sit\u00faa seis meses despu\u00e9s del final del Persona 5 original (Royal queda fuera de esta continuidad) por lo que Strikers vendr\u00eda a ser la secuela directa de Persona 5. Debido a esto, en los di\u00e1logos se referencia a veces la trama del juego anterior y hay arcos de personaje que los spoilean con apenas dos frases, por lo que mi recomendaci\u00f3n en este caso ser\u00eda o bien que juegues a Persona 5 o que veas el anime de \"Persona 5: The Animation\", el cual es basura pero te vas a hacer una buena idea de la trama y a\u00fan as\u00ed si luego quisieras jugar a P5 o P5R, seguir\u00edas sorprendi\u00e9ndote con el juego.\n\nCon las mec\u00e1nicas jugables y el combate lo que han querido hacer es mantener las que ya hab\u00eda en Persona 5, pero adapt\u00e1ndolo todo al combate en tiempo real y a un mapeado m\u00e1s grande y con m\u00e1s verticalidad, lo que en mi opini\u00f3n ha tenido muy buen resultado. Las mazmorras se dividen en mapas algo m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, los cuales se ir\u00e1n desbloqueando conforme avance la trama del juego, y que si bien pueden pasarse yendo en plan comando, lo ideal y la mejor estrategia es, al igual que en Persona 5, buscar sorprender al enemigo para empezar el combate con ventaja. Hay un cierto componente de exploraci\u00f3n pero el punto fuerte es que al igual que en Persona 4 Golden, habr\u00e1 objetivos extra en las mazmorras que ya has superado conforme avances en la historia.\n\nEl combate puede parecer un machacabotones simpl\u00f3n y sin mucha necesidad de pensar en qu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo, pero para nada es as\u00ed, precisamente todo lo contrario. Si bien hay mucho enemigo \"de relleno\" en pantalla (Los enemigos con m\u00e1scara, sombras que no han mostrado su verdadera forma) los que hay que tener en cuenta y en los que debes enfocarte son las sombras ya tan reconocibles de la saga Persona y Shin Megami Tensei, ya que hacen m\u00e1s da\u00f1o que los enemigos de relleno y pueden usar las mismas habilidades que los personajes principales (Ataques elementales y habilidades cuerpo a cuerpo).\n\nAl principio todo se soluciona con un combo o dos y alg\u00fan ataque de tu Persona, pero m\u00e1s pronto que tarde se ve que usar PE (Puntos de Estamina) a lo loco y atacar sin cabeza no es la mejor opci\u00f3n, ya que el combate tiene una profundidad que me recuerda mucho a Final Fantasy VII Remake, donde si bien es verdad que es un combate en tiempo real, tambi\u00e9n hay que ir con una estrategia en mente para cada enemigo y se puede pausar el combate para pensar en el pr\u00f3ximo movimiento. Un punto fuerte que dir\u00eda de este sistema es que la mec\u00e1nica del \"1-more\" y los \"All-out attacks\" siguen existiendo en Strikers, siendo que ahora el \"1-more\" permite realizar un ataque gratuito a un enemigo al que le hemos golpeado con su debilidad pero que no ha quedado expuesto, mientras que el \"All-out attack\" es un ataque de \u00e1rea con todos los miembros del grupo si un enemigo queda expuesto. A destacar que el modo dif\u00edcil no es a\u00f1adir m\u00e1s enemigos y ya, se pone a prueba si de verdad controlas las mec\u00e1nicas o si vas a recibir da\u00f1o por intentar fliparte.\n\nOtra cosa a destacar es que en Strikers no existe la gesti\u00f3n del tiempo ni los \"Social Links\", ya que por un lado se excusa que son las vacaciones de verano y no hab\u00eda necesidad de poner l\u00edmites de tiempo, dado que la historia avanza conforme cumplas los objetivos y no teniendo que llegar a X objetivo en tantos d\u00edas dentro del juego mientras que por otro lado el juego asume que has jugado a Persona 5 y que has maximizado todos los Social Links, por lo que aqu\u00ed se sustituyen por el sistema de \"V\u00ednculos\", que son habilidades pasivas que ayudan a progresar pasivamente a los personajes y dan bonificaciones tras ciertas acciones.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente no hay mucho de lo que hablar, es m\u00e1s Persona 5 tanto gr\u00e1ficamente como en la UI del juego y la versi\u00f3n de PC se ve bien y apenas he tenido un problema o dos con alguna textura de una pared durante un di\u00e1logo. El juego est\u00e1 capado a 30 \u00f3 60 frames, sin posibilidad de poder desbloquear el framerate, y la \u00fanica vez que he tenido un tir\u00f3n de frames fue durante un combate donde varios enemigos lanzaron Zio todos a la vez, pero por lo dem\u00e1s es una experiencia muy pulida y con un framerate estable.\n\nLa banda sonora es una maravilla, tanto los temas nuevos como los remixes m\u00e1s ca\u00f1eros de los temas originales de Persona 5, como \"Last Surprise\" o \"Rivers In The Desert\". Mi recomendaci\u00f3n en cuanto al doblaje es que si entiendes bien el ingl\u00e9s uses este, el cual no tiene nada que envidiarle al japon\u00e9s (Ryuji MVP, fight me) y adem\u00e1s durante los combates Morgana va dando consejos y hay conversaciones que ocurren durante estos y no es la mejor idea centrarse en leer los di\u00e1logos que salen arriba a la derecha mientras est\u00e1s ocupado d\u00e1ndote mamporros con los enemigos.\n\nF\u00e1cilmente un 9/10. Tiene sus cosas buenas y malas, pero puedo afirmar que \"Persona 5: Strikers\" ha sabido mantener la esencia de la saga Persona mientras que al mismo tiempo ha cogido como base los combates de los musou y les ha dado una vuelta de tuerca, adaptando las mec\u00e1nicas de RPG y sigilo de Persona 5 con un muy buen resultado.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 53, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "639aef742a6f5e3fb068024f84806967", "author": "71cc4f982a8b532ba6225522a9decb07", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5212, "content": "I've been waiting for this!", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3da42c6317fd5680803fe22f80209035", "author": "87d58d05a45a583daaf917eadfc63101", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1572, "content": "HOW CAN YOU RELEASE THIS IN PC PLATFORM WHEN THE ORIGINAL STILL NON EXISTENT, RELEASE PERSONA 5 ROYAL TO PC NOW AND TAKE OUR MONEY AS YOU TAKE OUR HEART ATLUS !!!!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e3b1dba75ba85a47940f55003b4b2c90", "author": "6845374b5d5b5e5da105132a4b9fb7e0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 945, "content": "\n\u2874\u2811\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u28c0\u28c0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\n\u2838\u2847\u2800\u283f\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u2874\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u2840\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2884\u28e0\u283e\u2801\u28c0\u28c4\u2848\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6 ta bueno\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2840\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u281b\u2802\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u287f\u28bf\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u287e\u28c1\u28c0\u2800\u2834\u2802\u2819\u28d7\u2840\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u282d\u28a4\u28f4\u28e6\u28e4\u28f9\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28b4\u28f6\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ee\u28fd\u28fe\u28ff\u28e5\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2882\u2814\u289a\u287f\u28bf\u28ff\u28e6\u28f4\u28fe\u2838\u28fc\u287f\n\u2800\u2880\u285e\u2801\u2819\u283b\u283f\u281f\u2809\u2800\u281b\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cc\u28a4\u28fc\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u285f\u2809\n\u2800\u28fe\u28f7\u28f6\u2807\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28c4\u28c0\u2840\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847compralo\n\u2800\u2809\u2808\u2809\u2800\u2800\u28a6\u2848\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u28fd\u2879\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2832\u28fd\u287b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28dc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ee\u28ed\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fa92b05bfa3b5d49a79a9e7e0b28327b", "author": "16db43ff67be54bb9e05b41b4d0803b0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4513, "content": "I am Joker Persona 5", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e61db8f912855597bfe6708b1c165d24", "author": "9ddf679602315e498d5cac2568fd279d", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2255, "content": "I think this game is a great addition to the Persona franchise.

ATLUS and KT Games succeed in mixing the Dynasty warriors gameplay of their games with the quality of worldbuilding, strong characters, good writing and sharp art design of Persona 5.\nThe Gameplay is action heavy and not too complex but still somehow engaging and nice to look at.\nThe game completely lacks the life sim of Persona and makes the time of the game play out as you complete specific story events. You can expect dynasty warriors gameplay but with a Persona Twist as you are able to stop time and attack your opponent(s) with a wide variety of physical and magic moves, that have different types, just like in a Pokemon Game. This adds a leven of complexity to the gameplay and preparation (SP).\nThe Game features FANTASTIC MUSIC both new and from the Persona 5 game. Also it features the good UX design from P5.\nThe game runs well on my 3070 at 4k60 max settings and my friends report a good experience even on dated Hardware like the 1060, you can expect 1080p60 max settings with a solid bit of overhead here.\nThe only thing that is a bit of a mixed bag is the difficulty, there are some spikes that could have been balanced better, and the UX during fights. (sometimes there is just tooo much happening on screen to see what your character is doing)\nIf you didn't play Persona 5: THIS GAME CONTAINS SPOILERS for that game and the Story does not properly explain the core concepts of Persona, that you need in order to understand everything well!!\nAll in all Persona5 Scramble: The phantom Strikers is a good game, that hase some flaws but is a mostly enjoyable experience.\nYou schould absolutely play it if:\n- You played and enjoyed Persona 5 and you desperately want to immerse yourself in that world again.\n- You like Dynasty Warriors Gameplay and have a solid idea of what Persona is all about\nYopu should avoid it if:\n- You are looking for a straight up Persona 5 sequel with life sim and all, this game is not that\n- you want ultra deep and complex Gameplay that is easy to learn, hard to master\n- You have never played a Persona Game or don't know what persona even is\n\nFor me PERSONALLY tha game is a 7/10\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9127c03e4d225a0eb9673f15f53b8e76", "author": "27391effa3bb59878e91e9cc8708f294", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1023, "content": "I only use Haru while playing this game. 10/10.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "419671fc7a2f51f9bb7339144a28f428", "author": "3345e28ef30f5c18a7998f32f354dce2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4947, "content": "Amazing continuation of persona 5 with really fun combat and a great story.

This game's twist is basically that it turns the traditional turn based Persona system into a stylish and dynamic real-time RPG with some hack-n-slash elements. Also this game is definitely quite easy until the ending where it gets somewhat challenging so I recommend to play on Hard which honestly feels kind of easy for someone new to the genre. Another gripe is that the game right now as a crashing issue and I see other people are experiencing it too - personally I have crashed like 7-8 times during my gameplay (usually when fast-travelling) so I HIGHLY recommend saving whenever you can until this issue is resolved. If you can look past these flaws, The story is solid, you'll get your values worth with ~40 hours of content, and the game is legitimately fun and addicting. \n\n8/10", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "4cf28a25952b51fb84f08810df897d44", "author": "8c2d57c7f3495c30bf9c72462112814b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3699, "content": "Persona on PC.

It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings.

It is basically Persona 5-2, but with a complete change in gameplay. If you enjoyed the original game, this title is a must. I'd say this is an almost perfect adaptation from the turn-based style to a hack-and-slash type of game, keeping the same Shadows weaknesses, strengths and spells.\n\nHowever, it has its flaws. By the time I'm writing this review the game kept crashing randomly, either while loading a new in-game rendered cutscene (which can make you lose quite a bit of progress in the first dungeons) or when entering a Jail. The Anti-Aliasing messes with the text a bit (not something that makes the game unplayable, but it feels a bit weird). \n\nThe Keyboard and Mouse Button Configuration is also severely lacking. It's not as bad as only having preset controls like Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but anything to the right of \"Enter\" is unbindable, which means anyone who uses the Arrow Keys will have a really hard time playing unless they have a controller.\n\nBut still, the game is awesome and well worth of being a sequel to Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "cf2e2296fc7e50cf8f34eddc820da876", "author": "72c927b52150567e8318c889eb09042e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1121, "content": "A great blending of action elements into a Persona game.

Son histoire est assez t\u00e2che, puisqu'on suit les Voleurs Fantomes en vacances dont chaque arr\u00eat se r\u00e9sumera par une nouvelle prison \u00e0 explorer (les nouveaux palaces du jeu), ceci \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, et sans chaque fois r\u00e9inventer la formule.\nLe sel de Persona \u00e9tait sa d\u00e9couverte de nouveaux personnages, la tension \u00e0 cause des limites de temps et surtout l'usure des combats au fur et \u00e0 mesure de notre progression.\nIci, tout se boucle en 3 jours, car tout est script\u00e9, les sorties, les affinit\u00e9s, les passages dans les prisons, et il suffit de sortir et revenir dans la prison dans une m\u00eame journ\u00e9e pour terminer ce qu'on a d\u00e9but\u00e9.\nBref, n'attendez pas de ce Persona d'\u00eatre Persona, car il le fait mal.\n\nLe gameplay est excellent, les combats sont dynamiques, nerveux et p\u00e9tillent de partout.\nLa DA de Persona ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ce gameplay donne une aura sublime et propre \u00e0 la license qu'on ne peut qu'appr\u00e9cier.\nLes boss sont impressionnants et sont assez relev\u00e9s, mais les passages de protection lors de piratages sont exquis, tant ils permettent de se d\u00e9fouler et de montrer son plein potentiel face \u00e0 des hordes impressionnantes d'ennemis.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 technique, le jeu p\u00eache pas mal puisque le chargement de lancement du jeu est INTERMINABLE, m\u00eame avec d'excellentes configs.\nDe plus, \u00e0 quelques reprises, il m'est arriv\u00e9 de crash en voulant entrer dans les prisons, et enfin la technique reste \u00e0 la ramasse, autant que Persona 5, sachant rappelons le que celui-ci est un jeu cross platform PS3/PS4, vous avez donc un aper\u00e7u de ce que donne cette suite, et c'est bien dommage.\n\nNiveau histoire, le jeu est assez terne, puisque comme vu plus haut, les histoires se finissent vite.\nUne prison correspond \u00e0 3 jours environ pour certaines, et on passe tout au plus une semaine entre la rencontre de l'antagoniste et sa m\u00e9tanoia.\nCeci est justifi\u00e9 par des vacances qu'il faut activement terminer, mais j'aurai pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'on diminue le nombre de prisons (que je ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lerai pas) pour des passages plus longs, mais plus intenses et plus proches de ce que la license proposait.\nHeureusement, chaque fin de prison est \u00e9mouvant, et rappelle subtilement pourquoi la license est aussi bonne, sa construction des personnages, et leur \u00e9volution suite \u00e0 leurs drames.\n\nEnfin, la BO est exceptionnelle !\nElle est en grande partie constitu\u00e9e de musiques de Persona 5, mais tous les th\u00e8mes de combat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 revus, et il y'a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de bonnes surprises dans les nouvelles.\n\nEn somme, Persona 5 Strikers est un plutot bon jeu, avec une DA et une BO toujours exceptionnelles, malheureusement terni par de nombreux d\u00e9fauts, qui n'en font pas moins un mauvais jeu, mais il reste le moins bon persona auquel j'ai pu jouer.\n\nBref, fans de la premi\u00e8re heure, foncez sans en attendre quoi que ce soit, et n\u00e9ophytes, jouez d'abord \u00e0 Persona 5 qui vous donnera sans broncher une exp\u00e9rience parfaite avant d'entamer celui-ci !", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id":

2017/2020 masterpiece.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves' sequel story was a joy the whole way through, and I'm incredibly happy to have been apart for it.  The writing is on par with the original and Royal, and while this game is more of a \"fan service-y\" type deal, Atlus made sure to not forget about what made Persona 5 great in the first place, creating a fun road trip adventure that didn't need to be told, but I'm glad it was. Seeing the thieves older and wiser while also keeping their charm and traits from the original mad me smile, and allowed me to truly see just how much these characters have grown. \n\nThe Musou style combat mixed in with Persona turn based elements came together perfectly, and while the camera can be a but weird sometimes, the combat always remained fluid and fun and never got boring even until the very end of the game. Persona fusion also makes a return, and while I have my quarrels with the new PP system, Persona Fusion is still crazy fun to do, allowing the player to create some incredibly OP Persona's that just shred enemies to a fine shadow-y paste. \n\nI became a huge Persona fan after playing Royal back in August. I never really was a JRPG guy, but for some reason Persona 5 always peaked my interest, and when I finally played it I fell in love. The Phantom Thieves are probably my favorite cast of video game characters period, and after 6 months of playing through the entire franchise, I was incredibly happy to be with the thieves on another adventure.

THIS GAME NOT ONLY CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, BUT ALSO BUILDS DIRECTLY ON THE PLOT OF P5 AND HEAVILY REFERENCES IT![/b]\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what a Persona Veteran and someone who's played through both P5 *and* P5R twice respectively, thinks of P5S so far:\n\nBiggest and most obvious change compared to the main series game is the combat system; instead of using the incredibly perfect turn-based combat approach from the main series, Strikers instead uses a realtime buttonmashing/Dynasty Warriors-ish kind of approach.\n\nWhen I first heard that, I was pretty disappointed, because Persona and turn-based just go hand in hand, and for very good reason.\n\nAfter having played it for myself, the first two hours or so I was still pretty on the fence, because it really was mostly button-mashing, and as I expected, the camera is a major hassle unless you lock on to a single enemy within a crowd of dozens.\n\nThe good news however is that it does get somewhat better over time, i.e. with story progress; you'll get environmental interactables that allow for special attacks, ranging from dashing onto a  lamp post to slide down with a wild spin-kicking tornado attack, to jumping on skateboards and just mowing down entire platoons of enemies, or even using stuff like oversized party poppers to bombard them from a distance.\nSo what the combat system lacks in tactical depth and detailed strategic combat gameplay, it reasonably makes up for in crazy and fun blowing-off-steam kind of combat escapades.\n\nAs for the story, it stays true to what we've seen in Persona 5, being a very well-written narrative with deeply emotional moments, philosophical questions, plot twists, as well as an overall theme that carries through 'til the end.\n\nI won't go into further details for obvious spoiler reasons, but suffice it to say that if you've loved P5's story, then'll you'll probably love P5:S's just the same, especially since the characters themselves reference a lot of the main storyline's key moments, and reminisce about the nostalgia of it all at pretty much the same time as you, the player, get that very same nostalgic feeling about encountering the main cast again.\n\nThe new members of the Phantom Thieves are also very intriguing and very well written (though one more so than the other, in my opinion), so look forward to discovering just what these two wil become over the course of the 25 - 35 hours of playtime.\nAll in all, this really feels much more like an addon to P5, story-wise, if not gameplay-wise, rather than \"just\" a spin-off.\n\nThere is some bad news too, however, namely in the [b]total lack of social/time management gameplay[/b] that is so typical of the Persona main series games.\nStrikers, sadly, is 100% linear, and fully scripted ... there's only one singular instance in the entire game where you can actually choose with whom to go on a ferris wheel ride, and that's it.\nNo romance, no confidants, nothing.\n\nThe same, equally sadly, goes for the Requests; compared to Persona 5 proper, in Strikers they are really, really uninspired, with 90+ percent consisting of generic fetch quests, or equally generic \"Kill X of Y in Z\" quests.\n\nAs I said (yelled from the rooftops :P) in the beginning, in my opinion, this game should only be played if you've already played through Persona 5 on console.\n\nIf you haven't yet, much of this game won't make much sense to you... you won't get any of the \"en passant\"-references, you won't really understand the major story references in highly emotional moments, and you don't even know the main cast at all, since Strikers doesn't bother to (re-)introduce them, instead expecting you to already know who they are, what they went through, how they became Phantom Thieves... you'd basically get thrown into a road trip of a group of extremely tight-knit friends whom you've never seen before in your life.\n\nAnd, again, the most important warning goes out to those of you who are still planning to play P5 eventually, maybe waiting for a potential PC release, or until they can afford console or game, or whatever:\n\n[b]Do _not_ play P5:S beforehand, it _will_ ruin large parts of the Persona 5 story and experience for you![/b]", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "b9a4992f20995974ae66eaccf2990c29", "author": "c1d9bfe152d151b6a404f631171627ed", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3070, "content": "I like it, it's fun.

Super charming to see the gang back together stealing twisted desires. Something I appreciate about this game is that it's not *just* a Warriors game, but it really feels like a bite sized Persona game with the life sim mechanics.

The game is utterly broken.\nI've bought a digital delix edition and i refunded 'cause the game wasn't ready at all. I decided to give it a second chance and bought just a game. And what do i see? Technically, P5S have launched is even WORSE, than P4G. What the hell is that, Atlus? An HOUR of endless blackscreen after an animetel Phantom Thieves loading-logo and a note that i don't have any save files. And my PC have succesefully launched Code Vein, i could play smoothly. I suppose, it's because of the opening. You again repeat same mistaces, as you did with P4G. I won't change this review until you patch the game. Because i *want* to play your Persona games, but i didn't pay for a piece of piss that doesn't work properly.\n\nUPD: I've managed to fix blackscreen and get 60fps, but only with the cost cutscenes. So.... Yeah! It's just like the launch of P4G with shuttering cutscenes and constant softlock that won't allow you to play the game AT ALL this time. In P4G, at least, they were with a slight chance and while All-Out-Attack. But here - you can't start the game completly [spoiler]after first battle, scene in police departament and reunion of the gang[/spoiler].

The story makes sure to show off the bonds the members of the Phantom Thieves have with each other, actually presenting them as a group of friends, something I feel the original was missing, and keeps much of the original presentation. Not quite reaching the same highs as the the original, but good nonetheless, carried almost entirely by its interesting and fun characters.\n\nUnfortunately the game comes with several technical issues. \nDue to the pandemic the English cast had to record their lines from home, and it really shows. While their performances are just as spectacular as in the original Persona 5, the audio quality and mixing is all over the place with certain lines being hardly audible, especially near the very beginning of the game, though it does get better and less noticeable as the game goes on.\nThe game also suffers from terrible aliasing and texture compression that makes it look like the image is built out of Minecraft blocks, and a faulty Anti-Aliasing solution that makes everything look smudged, including the text, which is a real shame because the UI and art of this game ooze style, just like Persona 5! The ability to increase render scaling does help to alleviate some of the issues, so marginally, the image quality can look better than on the PlayStation consoles.\nCoupled with a 60 FPS cap and no analogue movement support, makes this merely an OK port.\n\nThat is, [u][b]if the game works for you at all[/b][/u]. The version available for purchase right now is filled with many issues that directly inhibit your ability to play it. From infinite loading screens and constant crashes to just annoyingly long load times. With these severe issues seemingly being caused by the Denuvo DRM used for the game as the accidentally released DRM-Free version that came out with the Digital Deluxe edition pre-release suffers from none of these.\nAlthough users have found some supposed workarounds, the best way to fix this seems to be to somehow acquire the DRM-Free version of the executable.\n\nIf you are able to overcome the constant crashing and infinite loading times, the rest of these issues are easy to look past though with the fast paced action, charming characters, and the fun times you'll have with the Phantom Thieves in this sequel!\n\n[spoiler] Haru best girl.

Es importante remarcarlo porque son distintas. De todas maneras, me da la impresi\u00f3n de que tampoco se contradicen en nada importante, as\u00ed que digamos que tambi\u00e9n sirve. \n\nEl juego es una mezcla muy interesante entre Musou, juego de acci\u00f3n y RPG. El gameplay transcurre de la siguiente manera:\nNavegas por un mapa m\u00e1s o menos abiertos, que son las \"C\u00e1rceles\". Hay unos enemigos a los que puedes atacar/emboscar/ser emboscado, y al hacerlo, comienza el combate en s\u00ed, aparecen muchos enemigos, y empieza la acci\u00f3n al estilo Musou. Durante el combate, est\u00e1s relegado a una zona amplia, pero no puedes navegar por todo el mapa. \nEn cuanto a los enemigos, hay una mezcla entre: \n- Demonios/ Personas jefes, que podr\u00edan ser los generales t\u00edpicos de los Musou.\n- Demonios / Personas rasos, que tienen sus habilidades y debilidades propias y aparecen en gran n\u00famero\n- Bichos gen\u00e9ricos que est\u00e1n como carnaza. No tienen habilidades especiales pero bueno, atacan y hacen bulto. \n\nCon los dos primeros, el combate funciona igual que en el Persona 5 normal en cuanto a debilidades y habilidades. Puedes usar tu persona en combate, y si les golpeas con habilidades a las que son d\u00e9biles, vas debilitando sus escudos, que tienen varias capas. Cada vez que rompes una capa, puedes hacer un ataque extra, y cuando rompes todas las capas, puedes hacer un \"All out Atack\" para quitarle un trozo importante de vida y quedar guay. \n\nLos personajes tienen ataque normal, ataque especial, arma de fuego y su Persona. El ataque normal es el combo b\u00e1sico, y si usas el ataque especial tras hacer un n\u00famero de ataques normales, har\u00e1s un combo distinto, como en todos los Musou. El arma de fuego es, eso, disparar. Cada miembro usa un arma de fuego distinta. \nLos Persona se usan en tiempo real. Cada habilidad tiene un \u00e1rea de alcance.  \nEn cuanto a la movilidad, tienes un bot\u00f3n de esquivar/esprintar, bot\u00f3n de salto, y un bot\u00f3n de interacci\u00f3n con el mapa, que te permite hacer cosas como girar en un poste para pegar patadas. \n\nEs importante recalcar que cada puedes usar a TODOS LOS MIEMBROS DE LOS PHANTOM THIEF DURANTE TODA LA PARTE JUGABLE (DE ACCI\u00d3N), y cada uno es distinto en su estilo. Yusuke, por ejemplo, se especializa en golpear muchas veces a gran velocidad, Morgana se transforma en coche para arrasar en \u00e1rea, Ryuji puede cargar sus ataques especiales para pegar m\u00e1s fuerte, etc\u00e9tera. Todos los personajes tienen, tambi\u00e9n, una serie de habilidades especiales que se desbloquean mientras los usas, como por ejemplo, nuevos combos o propiedades especiales. Un ejemplo de esto es una habilidad que permite a Joker dar un ataque m\u00e1s despu\u00e9s de impactar un disparo. \n\nEl resto del tiempo es una novela gr\u00e1fica con exploraci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y conversaciones. No hay conversaciones personales ni Social Links, pero si puedes fortalecer el v\u00ednculo del equipo y ganar puntos de V\u00ednculo, que luego puedes usar para mejorar habilidades generales, como por ejemplo, dar m\u00e1s puntos de vida a todos los personajes.\n\nEn cuanto a la historia, empieza muy bien, y la tem\u00e1tica de viaje creo que es muy divertida. No puedo opinar m\u00e1s a fondo pero si te gust\u00f3 la historia de Persona 5, seguramente disfrutes esta. \n\n\nEn general, lo recomiendo much\u00edsimo. Es muy divertido, y la acci\u00f3n es fren\u00e9tica. Tiene lo mejor de los Musou y de los RPG a la vez. Actualizar\u00e9 la rese\u00f1a cuando lo termine.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "514d6cc4622d53c1bb4f4a9d4689883c", "author": "99b7e7b5c4535e7fab177b4973a65d3b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 6570, "content": "Fun and addicting game, a month++ long summer road trip around Japan with the Phantom Thieves and Feathermobile while saving humanity as a side quest XD.

Fundamentally, modern Persona is defined by its balance between the RPG dungeon crawling and the life sim, tying them together with a calendar. This game removes the time constraints, making the calendar mere decoration. Moreover, social links/confidants are replaced with the Bond system, giving players access to a variety of perks of their choosing. The fusion system itself has also been greatly simplified. With all of this in mind, it seems as though this game throws out everything that made its predecessors special. However, this game gains more focus on narrative as a result of this. Many fun character interactions stem from this focus and smaller cast. It allows the game to take a form all its own, rather than being more of the same. And all the more, the battles still feel very Persona-esque thanks to ailments, follow-ups, baton passes, weakness, technicals, All-Out Attacks, Persona-switching, and more. I can't recommend this if you don't like action games. But if you even have a minor interest and you played the original/Royal Persona 5, then I heavily recommend this game.

I like Warriors games. This is an excellent marriage of the two of them that's missing some pros of the former while dodging many of the mistakes of the latter. Social links and time management aren't represented here. But we've got dungeons and lengthy story sequences. The different locations can also be explored to purchase new recipes or talk with your teammates. Sometimes they have special items to give you. Strikers has a similar flow to that of Persona 5 and tells a story that isn't completely unlike that one. It's just different enough, though, and it has the same great writing. \n\nI was worried that the dialogue and plot would feel subpar since this is a spinoff and didn't have the series' main director in charge. But that isn't the case. Strikers looks and feels just like Persona 5 did. The combat is great too. You've got your Warriors charge attacks, except the Phantom Thieves moves all tie in with their Personas. Most of their C3s use the strongest version of their elemental attack, which you can hit enemies with. Once hit with this attack, enemies become vulnerable to a One More attack or All-out Attack. It works a hell of a lot like Persona. You can also summon your Persona, which stops time and lets you think things through. The character's skill lists are the same as you remember them too. If you want to focus on buffs and debuffs while shooting off afflictions, that's something you can do.\n\nIt's pretty much exactly what it should be. It's not as long as Persona 5 by any stretch of the mind, but it's still a lengthy game. If you try and do all of the requests and keep going after beating the game, then you can easily put over 40 hours into it. This is a solid port too, even if the anti-aliasing isn't all that great. It does crash occasionally as well, but it's certainly not common. The only thing I didn't like much was how dumbed down fusing Personas in the Velvet Room is. You can't pick two Personas and combine them anymore. You have to pretty much fuse by result with a minimum level and it's not as enjoyable as the mainline games for that reason. Regardless, this is a remarkable game that any Persona fan will likely enjoy.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c0add3c0d2e25370a51bd9a9e5d30c9a", "author": "fc1ba4af53cb56ff8c134dfcb5d5a950", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 381, "content": "A solid addition to the persona series.

Since Persona 5 is a complete game of its own, there are no major plot points that you need to know to play the game. However, you need to know the major characters from Persona 5 to be able to enjoy Persona 5 Strikers. If you have not watched or played Persona 5, please at least read the wiki pages on all the playable characters.\n\nSecond, the combat changes drastically from Persona 5 (turn-based RPG) to hack-and-slash (specifically Warrior/Musou style aka the Omega-Force style). Check out the gameplay video if you don't know what this means. Most other major Persona gameplay mechanics remain the same (protag wild card personas, level up, etc).\n\nIf you've read up to here and you're okay with everything I've said so far, this is THE GAME for you. \n\nThis game is basically everything you love about Persona 5 on steroid. This game sets during the Summer right after Persona 5 ended. You'd get to see how characters you loved from Persona 5 grow, how they use what they've learned to help people as the Phantom Thieves. One thing that I think Persona 4 did better than Persona 5 is the character development, but Persona 5 Strikers easily outrank Persona 4 on this front (partially because all characters are available and interacting since the beginning of the game).", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "89c6be80d1025cc2a102d5cdc3790eb6", "author": "1b019e0b745e5f8491aa3bab32b06c4e", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2316, "content": "persomna good", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "87b6b43fd2495efb9466d5b90b86afd8", "author": "d69ca98256ac5925935a319c0953a097", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1325, "content": "\u597d\u73a9\nP5\u725b\u903c", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a3598d4225dc5367b3b3c0581367dbc6", "author": "67d5a5fdfd7a5e339abdc3828e68981f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3613, "content": "TE AMO MAKOTO NIIJIMA TE AMOOOOO", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 121, "funny": 27, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "5aa9d706be055620a6cc2206f98bcb3e", "author": "00bfad5a3b7e5d539e0f4b32b46c8974", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 247, "content": "The only logical step now is to bring Person 1-3 and 5 to Steam\n\nOnly then will Atlus truly steal my heart like the Phantom Thieves they are", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 4, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "257289cd3b2f5f4f8cbff0999dda12d8", "author": "d3c783557a815ccd835cb8c6655a23fb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2969, "content": "Don't worry, this isn't just a throwaway Persona spin-off that lasts 10 hours.

serie Persona. La soundtrack \u00e8 superlativa come ogni gioco della serie: ogni traccia si adatta benissimo al contesto (gradita l'inclusione di alcune tracce del gioco originale). La traduzione in italiano \u00e8 ottima ed incarna perfettamente lo spirito dei personaggi. La storia fin ora sembra interessante e con i personaggi nuovi integrati egregiamente all'interno del nuovo arco narrativo. A differenza della Deluxe edition di P4G, nel pacchetto \u00e8 inclusa un'applicazione che racchiude tutti i contenuti bonus: ha uno stile molto carino e permette di accedere a tutte le OST, un artbook interattivo e il behind the scenes. \n\nDopo 112 ore l'ho finalmente completato al 100%, quindi posso valutarlo da sotto tutti i punti di vista.\n\nPORTING SU PC\n\nSoprattutto nei primi giorni dopo il day one, il gioco soffriva di molte problematiche: crash improvvisi, ritardo dell'audio, etc... Ma ora, grazie alle due patch rilasciate, l'esperienza di gioco \u00e8 migliorata di molto. Anche se c'\u00e8 ancora molto da fare, Atlus \u00e8 definitivamente sulla buona strada. A livello tecnico \u00e8 accettabile (almeno finch\u00e9 non rilasciano nuove patch).\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nL'utilizzo delle diverse combo per attivare le abilit\u00e0 delle diverse Personae pu\u00f2 risultare all'inizio un p\u00f2 difficile da capire, ma \u00e8 una di quelle cose che si imparano solamente giocando e perci\u00f2 non risulta infine fastidioso. \u00c8 stata una scelta necessaria per adattare lo stile \"Musou\" alla serie Persona, insieme ai vari stili di combattimento dei personaggi che risultano molto fedeli alle loro personalit\u00e0. Al di fuori del campo di battaglia \u00e8 tutto identico a Persona 5: la componente stealth e le interazioni sociali. Quest'ultime mancano per\u00f2 del sistema dei \"Confidant\", a causa della brevit\u00e0 del gioco (la vicenda si svolge in circa un mese nel gioco), ma questa mancanza non si fa sentire, grazie alla scorre\n\nSTORIA\n\nAlternati a momenti divertenti, sono presenti anche momenti di estremo spessore e significato. Lo sviluppo dei nuovi personaggi rispecchia pienamente lo stile degli altri giochi della serie e regala molti spunti di riflessione. Per il resto i \"vecchi\" personaggi si rifanno al loro character development del precedente gioco. Nulla di male contando che Persona 5 Strikers \u00e8 un sequel effettivo del Persona 5 \"vanilla\", perci\u00f2 non \u00e8 presente alcun riferimento alle aggiunte della versione Royal.\n\nEstremamente consigliato a tutti i fan della serie Persona e per chi desidera \"entrare\" in questo mondo, consiglio di recuperarsi gli altri giochi nell'attesa di vedere Persona 5 Royal su Steam", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 15, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e53476477a9e56ce86db9fe968eb267b", "author": "eaf9c98a77c1558ab864aba8952f79e1", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2573, "content": "Persona 5...but MORE.

Even the combat itself doesn't feel out of place and seamlessly flows in and out whenever fights start.\n\nThis game has all the elements of persona 5 woven into it in an interesting way, things like baton passes, follow up attacks, persona fusing and all out attacks are still here but made to fit the hack and slash gameplay of a warriors game.\nThe difficulty is actually decent for one of these type games too, usually you just mindlessly mash buttons and feel good taking out thousands at a time but here there are fewer enemies on screen and a harder fight overall, the bosses themselves are also unique and are much more challenging than anything found in its similar titles.\n\nThe music to this game shattered my expectations, I assumed it would be good already seeing as both of the franchises have amazing music already but they really outdid themselves. I got the legacy music pack expecting to flick to that but so far i haven't even wanted to incase i missed out on any of the incredible new tracks.\n\nThe DLC for this game in terms of items is definitely skippable, it honestly doesn't do much at all and so far I haven't used any of it myself. The persona level up points may come in handy eventually but the skills haven't really been necessary, they already give you tons and if you have played a persona game before then you already know how to fuse your way to victory.\n\nThe story takes place after regular Persona 5 and not Royal. As such some players of the newer version may notice differences in character portraits or persona passives in fusing. The new character from royal also doesn't make an appearance but there are plenty more new faces added regardless\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that the game looks similar to the ps3 version of P5 and the text is a little off putting at first. I eventually got used to it but I wish there were options to make it look a bit smoother. Other than that it runs fine during gameplay with the occasional crash which can be annoying though it throws so many opportunities to save at you that the most progress I lost was 1 cutscene that i skipped upon reloading anyway.\n\nOverall I'd say this is the most amount of effort of any Koei-Tecmo mainline or spin-off game and even people who don't like their usual stuff should give this one a shot.

So, a little thing about me, Persona 5 is my favorite game, of all the one's ive played, and i've played it through several times and royal the same. So when i hear about a spin off of my favorite game, i'm not only skeptical, but i feel like i had a higher expectation for this game than other games. This is a very promising game, as of current i'm only on the second (To not spoil) \"Part\". It's not just a Dynasty warrior style game with a shiny persona coat of paint on it, as it presents more of a different style and challenge than the normal copy pasted format.\n\nThe story is on par with any other persona style story: Very engaging, very in depth, and full of small fun ventures of the phantom thieves in their everyday lives as teenagers. The thing that surprised me was the game play itself. It's not just a copy or direct version of a \"Warriors\" style of game, but offers more of a twist on the combat. With the resistances of not just the larger personas, or the \"Generals\" in the other warrior games, but even all of the small fry shadows that liter the battlefield. You have to be mindful of all the resistances, all the weaknesses, and all of your parties SP and HP gauges, allowing there to be a higher skill ceiling for you to pull off some sweet ass combos. \n\nI also really enjoy that the game is difficult, it's not just \"Smash square to kill all the enemies\" like other warriors games, but it really makes you wary of all the enemies at the same time, and makes you use some brainpower to play. There are only three difficulties (Maybe more later or once i finish the game) But the game is definitely more of a challenge than i was expecting.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game. Maybe i'll update this review later once i beat the game, but for having a 14 hour save and only on the second part, i'm looking forward to how much content there is in the game, and how much more fun i will have with this game. If you like Warriors style games, this is an easy grab, just expect it to be harder than usual. If you're a persona fan, it's got all your favorite characters, plus some new ones (Especially one super adorable character), and it currently has the persona style story.

It doesn't quite have that 'one versus a thousand' feeling of being a badass, combat is a bit more small-scale and implements a lot of Persona gameplay for better or worse. \n\nThe story's been great so far, the new characters are really interesting, and goddamn does the P5 aesthetic continue to kick ass.\n\nLike I said, an overall recommendation from me, but I'm not exactly sure who this gameplay's intended for, while it's not *bad* it doesn't really appeal to me as a Persona fan, nor as a Warriors fan.

These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n", "comments": 13, "source": "steam", "helpful": 120, "funny": 9, "recommended": false, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3359a44ead4b562f884de244f78ec653", "author": "16835b1e3cd35f11b6e7a088353bf897", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2396, "content": "Save your game.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c146bce823ef5affa6407f01cf82d628", "author": "3f3ac5536ddd5d46bb6d38662761111c", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2582, "content": "awesome", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "75569dd1a3715fb1a69dc842f149a723", "author": "981bea45a8d3583b8feafc3997378946", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2390, "content": "Summer vacation simulator", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8b49cbd42def5594bd85bdb4ea625d72", "author": "49f477f0c14a52b6b2cfa3c870d5e6c3", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3399, "content": "The best game 10/10", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "042ec51e23045df08a31136cff9efa4b", "author": "1cba896d235951bb8d1701de82ffbbdb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 5954, "content": "Sucks that Royal isn't on PC yet but this is a great sequel that transcends the definition of musou/warriors.

The game runs incredibly smooth as well, though it seems to have a 60 fps cap if that matters at all to anyone. The plot even follows a similar progression to the main game, so it can also be host to bout of nostalgia if it's been a while since you originally danced with the Phantom Thieves.  Most of the time management mechanics have been removed and you don't need to worry about hustling or figuring out who is the best to spend your time with. There are still moments where you can miss limited time items or side requests if you push on ahead without completing them. You can exit and enter dungeons without penalty and are otherwise encouraged to do so to replenish your HP and SP. Combos feel really good and even incorporate Persona skills, so you always have an avenue to attack enemy weaknesses. All the new characters are also great additions as well, and mesh well with the returning cast. \n\n30 hours in, I can still say that it should provide any P5 fans both a new and familiar experience, and it stands as probably one of my favorite Musou games, based on both the quality of the writing and the fantastic combat.  \n", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "9b79d3c541ea5ba2a82757aa3f304fd2", "author": "5ff2fa91819055599583da22212f7558", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 19, "content": "Looking cool Joker!", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a4e9de25237f5dc8a69bdcfb152f808b", "author": "8c739471713c54d9aa32d68f4b1b9ddb", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4700, "content": "Great game.

The game runs great now. It's run great since they patched it back in June 2021. Now that performance isn't an issue, I've gotta say that this game is incredibly fun. You might say that it's just a coat of Persona 5 on an otherwise vanilla Musou game and I'd say that's pretty fair, but it's a pretty thick coat of Persona 5 and that really changes the flavor dramatically. This is the kinda collab Musou game that can get non-Warriors fans into the genre. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed Persona 5. I don't know if I'd recommend it to someone who's not played the original, though. It leans on your knowledge of the characters pretty heavily, even if it doesn't really need you to know the original story.\n\n\n\nOld review: This might one day be a fantastic game, but right now I've gotta say hold off on buying it until they fix all the bugs. I and numerous other people have had some fairly frequent and obnoxious bugs. I've had to fight 2 bosses multiple times because the following cutscenes cause me to crash to desktop. I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible. When they patch this game to an acceptable level, I'll completely rewrite this review.", "comments": 15, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "1c5f384dc8185afeaedabb61c0e202ea", "author": "4de106827d5255a0b3cfb8e8618862a6", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3310, "content": "this game is good ol persona 5 goodness and the best muso game out there. the combat is basic muso press attack and combo into special. each characters moves and animations are true to the characters and they all have their own little changes from the others. the persona abilities stop time so you can  choose what skill to use and where to drop it. they even added to sneak attack into the game so you can get the advantage on the enemy. each character get a special showtime attack thats basically a super, you fill the meter and hit them with the showtime. you are able to hold on to it as long as you want until you leave the dungeon. all in all this game is alot of fun and i highly recommend if you are a persona 5 fan. damn this game is good.\n\np.s.

I've been having a blast and I love how the voice actors came back and voiced their characters with more enthusiasm (Especially Ryuji). So yeah, it's a great game and I recommend it.\n\n\nUpdate: Now that I have finished the game I can properly say that this game is an amazing sequel to the original persona 5 and a true love letter to the fans. Even though p5 is getting milked to all hell, you can tell that they put the effort and made a great game which recaptures the vibe of the original while still being completely different.

recommend this to any Persona fan or an RPG fan in general. I've played Persona 5 (PLAY THE ORIGINAL PERSONA 5 GAME FIRST TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY! This doesn't connect to Persona 5 Royal at all so it's best to play the original) and loved it and once I played this game I loved it even more. The concept of the game was cool too! The way you get to roam freely during battles! The platforming and companions you meet along the way. I got into Persona 2 years ago and never thought I'd like it but the story of each game that was made of the Persona series I instantly became attached to the series. \nGraphics for the game are awesome if thats what you are looking for in a game it preforms PHENOMENALLY on my computer well with the recommendations for specs I'm sure it can run fine on a lower graphics card than mine hah. If you decide to buy the game then you did a good deed because you won't stop playing the first day I was able to play it I spent over a whole 12 hrs playing the game! YES I got into the game! But that's it for this review!

You're in for a fresh change of pace if you came from the original turn-based combat of the Persona/SMT games.\nHowever, the negotiation system that was used in P5/P5R is absent from this game, I personally find it disappointing. Although, I think some people might find it more likeable since you don't need to went through the pain of figuring out the demon's personality, you can now just collect personas by collecting the mask that drops from battle.\n\nGraphics while not that amazing, are still stylish as it were in the original P5/P5 royal. If you like both the art direction and the graphics of the original game, you'll feel right at home when playing this game.\n\nMusics are great, some are remixes from the original P5 soundtracks, others are new addition for P5S.\n\nStory drags down a lot for the first 2 hours, and also recycle lot of story elements from the original P5 for the character's development, but there's a new story elements found in the new addition of Jails, another type of Metaverse that becomes the dungeon in P5S. I'll update my review for the story part after completing the game, for now I'll say that it feels like a bit watered down version compared to P5(I find P5R to be better than this one).\n\nPerformance is smooth, this game is highly optimized for a first port of current-gen persona game, the game managed to stay at 60fps in my GTX 1650 Ti, with all the settings maxed out in 1080p.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "e1a9dc13948358c99326ddc129630291", "author": "2ec4a7df27765eccae252bcb99c60c88", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4103, "content": "despite the original not being on steam, if you're someone who doesn't care about the story, this is a very fun game to play.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "51a73231f80a54f58a8aa905a8956c82", "author": "49eb448a8d0b5c799e696ba895a734d8", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 863, "content": "If you are a fan of Persona games, pick this up! Does not have all the \"slice of life\" activities that Persona game's are famous for, but is still story rich. New character \"Humanity's Companion\" is cute as F***. Not recommended for those just looking for a new hack n' slash, a lot of dialogue disrupts the pacing. Fans are used to it, you have been warned.\n\nPros------------------------\n\n-Unique Mushou combat experience with Persona 5 theme. All out attacks, Persona System\n\n-Story picks up after events of Persona 5 after one year\n\n-Music is great\n\n-English Va's put on a great performance (subjective I understand)\n\n-Japanese voices are optional if you are not into English dubs \n\n-New Baddies (I have only fought the first boss so far) \n\n-Checkpoints are placed pretty well and makes re-entry less of a hassle taking out a lot of backtracking.\n\n-Humanity's Companion > Siri\n\n-Ambushing shadows feels great\n\nCons-------------------------\n\n- Camera can be wacky\n\n- Game is not good for players who have not played the original. No backstory, no summary of events, no recap of the original game whatsoever. \n\n- If you have not played the original, you will not be used to dialogue. There is a TON of dialogue. Great if you are a fan, annoying if you are new to the series or are just looking for a hack n' slash.\n\n- Most of the characters you bonded with in last game are MIA if they were not the main cast.

Pourquoi ?\nLes m\u00e9caniques de P5 au niveau des types reste les m\u00eame et les maps ne sont absolument pas celles de musou classique. On se croirait vraiment dans P5.

Constant 60fps is nice. Also, for the time being disable the AA because it does barely anything and blurs the text. \n\nRegarding the album/artbook promised by the front page, it's a separate executable, not files, you will not be able to put it on your phone and no reasonable person launches an exe to listen to music. They need to either scrub that off the front page, provide the soundtrack or clarify what they mean by \"soundtrack\" this is severely misleading on a storefront that also sells music.\n\nOutside of that, I really enjoy this game. It's characterization is surprisingly on point and nobody feels like a shell of their character, which is a big issue I have with persona spinoffs. On the topic of spinoffs, this is kind of a direct sequel to persona 5. I don't think you absolutely need to play the original game to understand it but I think it's most satisfying if you had. They do touch on the plot of the previous game but not really enough to spoil it in a way you would remember by the time you got around to it.\n\nAll the characters get touching moments, the new characters are very fun and the events are written to the same quality as the original Persona 5. I actually think to a degree the core dungeons are more interesting in their thematics than the original ones were. \n\nThe music is fantastic, which brings back the issue of them lying about the soundtrack. I legitimately bought this on steam because I wanted it on steam, but that's still a massive bummer. The new music is really good and the remixes I assume done by omega force are the same kinda goofy turn-off-brain guitar tracks that I love those soundtracks for. It's the best of both worlds. \n\nGameplaywise, this is probably the best translation of a turn based rpg to an action game I've seen. It's still as frenetic as a warriors game, but you will absolutely get destroyed if you ignore elemental weaknesses, which motivates the constant switching of characters, and even though it's a pretty small roster, they're all very fun to play. Also it is surprisingly difficult for a warriors game even on normal. \n\nWhen I played during the pre-release I had a few hard crashes but I stopped getting them after the first jail so either they were fixed at some point or the first jail is the location of basically all of them. Either way I would save regularly, whenever you can. \n\nAlso the Anti Aliasing needs to be improved. I know it probably will via mods but this would be a really pretty game if the aliasing didn't completely destroy all of the pleasant cleanness of it all. \n\nOverall not the best port and they lied about the soundtrack but recommended for the game itself.

If you have not played the original you will be missing out a lot in the experience, some stuff straight up won't make sense (Hopefully someday Atlus releases the original to PC as well).\n\nAlthough not as long as the first instalment, P5S's story involves the Phantom Thieves taking a road trip all over Japan. This new setting really allowed the developers to expand more on the world of the Persona franchise with many hints to previous games (Haha Hotspring incident). The story is told incredibly well and is a nice change of pace avoiding rehashing the first games plot too much. \n\nFun Fact:\nFunnily enough, this exact concept is what the original Persona 5 developers wanted for the first game although it was scraped due to inappropriate timing alongside real world events (Great East Japan Earthquake).\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nAs the game was made in combination with ATLUS and Omega Force (The company behind the Warrior fighting games such as Dynasty Warriors, Hyrule Warriors etc) The gameplay is [b] very [/b] different to any other Persona game in the franchise. Instead of the same turn based combat found across the series, you are instead greeted to Warriors-Styled Hack&Slash gameplay which pairs extremely well with Personas core concepts. I would be confident saying the combat style rivals the turn based nature of the other games in the franchise, although it sometimes can feel pretty messy with everything happening at once cluttering up your screen. It is certainly a tonne of fun though.\n\nIn future I would honestly be down to see a full Persona game adopting this fighting style again. Of course keep the turn based combats for the main releases, however if Omega Force wants to partner with ATLUS for another Persona/Warriors game, I'm most certainly down.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nHoly fuck, the music in this game is amazing. P5S basically takes the original P5's soundtrack and mixes it with more upbeat styles to fit the more quickened gameplay, with heaps of rock elements added alongside. \n\nIt would be a sin against this game to not give the soundtrack a perfect score as a minimum, Its that good. \n\n[u]Wrapping it Up:[/u]\nAs stated above, I really don't want to go too deep into the story elements as this game is still very new. Just know it gets an almost perfect score from me with its only flaw being it had to follow the original, and that in all honesty is unfair. \n\nif you have played Persona 5/Royal and your looking for more Phantom Thief action, pick this one up.\n\n\n\n\n\n [h1] Makoto best girl btw [/h1]", "comments": 5, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "fe6a49b8b8605dab87d7e0b52aaa55ef", "author": "04921b84a5555e828a1fc388a198d07b", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2852, "content": "ATLUS stole my desires, for I have purchased two copies of this game (PS4 and Steam) The power of the Monarchs is real!\n\n\n\nShadow Alice in mad rabbit form is nightmare fuel.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "3bb0340309a05cc69480b13c251a3427", "author": "11624e8ab0945953a2566f75cba301a4", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1821, "content": "A great beat em up Persona game, though if you are looking for the RPG elements you found in Persona 5 on PS4 you will be disappointed.

But I don't own any console and wanted to experience. So when P5S was announced I was very much excited, then I come to know that it will be pretty different experience than mainline series with hack and slash gameplay but with characters of P5. I was in a doubt whether I will enjoy this or not because of lack of connections with the lore + characters from the P5. But still I went for it.\nNow the question is did I enjoy this? \nYes, absolutely (to my surprise!)\nCharacters are introduced in a way you get a chance to know about them and chemistry between them (yes, it won't match the connection you might have if played P5 but still its serviceable)\nGameplay is fun and will keep you playing.\nOne big con for the port is that it's unstable as hell (I played early access version so it might not reflect the product on release day) as I experienced multiple crashes when changing between the locations. [This problem has bigger consequence because the game doesn't have autosave system and you can only save at particular locations. So, there is a chance that you might lose large chunk of progress, thus I advise you to save frequently.)\nSo to conclude, I am enjoying the game. Yes, I would have enjoyed it more if (1) I didn't face so many crashes and (2) had played Persona 5.\nSo I do recommend this game to anyone who has played the previous game, but if you haven't I suggest you go with an open mind and you might enjoy the company of the Phantom Thieves.\n\u00a0\nPS- Please ATLUS, don't leave players like me hanging, and give us a PC port of Persona 5 Royal.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "00ab4db3ebc357238b717a125708011c", "author": "adb85533a617596282affe1cfcedc2d6", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3857, "content": "Great sequel to an already great game.

The charm and style of Persona is dominant and is present in everything. If you enjoyed the cast and story of P5, but not the combat, i would 100% recommend this as it truly feels like a P5 sequel with action combat and no social management (but don't worry, you'll spend plenty of time in running around, in cut scenes and story beats with your crew. \n\nOverall, as a huge fan of P5, this is a must. The combat is fast pace and refreshing and absolutely captures the essence of the original game. I wish it did have some social stuff but as a spin off, it's fine as is. \n\nMy one slight negative is that if you never played P5 or watched the story, they don't really explain much and it does jump right in after the events of P5 so new players, be aware that some of the game kinda expect you to know what previously happened. \n\nOn the technical side, i'm playing on an ultra-wide monitor at 3440x1440 with a 2080ti and the performance is flawless. constant 75+ fps.

In general, I think this is a good game and enjoyed most of my time with it. However, there is definitely parts I did not like.\n\nStory:\n For the most part, I thought the story was fun. There were times where it got dull or just felt extremely rushed that I didn't like, but I overall liked the story. There is a decent amount of parts that do feel like reuses of things that happened in the series before, mainly Persona 5. Those didn't really bother me too much except for at a certain point in the story that I just found to be extremely lazy writing. I also found two of the villains to either be too \"evil\" or not a bad person for the most part.\n\nGameplay:\n Personally I love the gameplay. I find it really fun and a unique twist on the gameplay style for the type of game this is. If you are not a fan of the beat em up style of Warriors games, then you'll probably not like the gameplay as much. However, there is enough differences in my opinion that would make it worth a shot atleast. It also has the dungeon crawling of a normal Persona game, just not exactly the same. There is more expansive spaces than a typical Persona game.\n\nCharacters:\n For the most part I really liked the returning cast and the new cast added to this game. There were some points I found the returning cast used the same jokes too much, but other than that I liked them about as much as in P5/P5R. I honestly loved the new main cast characters. I found their character arcs, story and personality amazing. They were just overall really good characters. There were some not as major characters that I really liked as well. Overall, I just really liked the characters of this game.\n\nSound:\n I absolutely loved the soundtrack of this game. All the returning songs were great and all the new songs were amazing. There are even remixes of some returning songs and those remixes are so so good. The rest of the sounds were overall pretty good. There were only a few times where I didn't think sounds fit what was going on. As an example, there were some moves that just didn't fit the noise they made and threw me off.\n\n \n In the end, I still feel this is a really good game and a pretty good sequel to Persona 5. I also think it could fit for P5R a bit more than I originally thought when I got it.

Brings me right back to April of 2017. I've been playing this on the Digital Deluxe Pre-release, and while there are a few issues with loading screens, they'll likely be fixed with the day one patch.\n\nGameplay wise, this FEELS like Persona, but as an action game. There's some Dynasty Warriors/Musou influence, yes, but it doesn't have the same map control/base defense loop that Musou often has in its spinoffs (e.g. Hyrule Warriors) and instead opts to give much more of the stage to Persona 5. For returning fans, Fusion is back, but it's less about picking which Personas you want to fuse, and is a bit more linear. The most important part is getting different Personas, since EACH ONE will CHANGE Joker's moveset in few ways, and the Persona he has equipped can freely cast some preset skills (tied to each individual Persona) by using his Persona combo finishers. You can still fuse some pretty impressive Personas if you want to, with Reflect/Absorbs and the like, but it's not as important.\n\n\nThe other characters all feel really, really good; even in comparison to Joker, and they EACH have their own unique attribute to set them apart! Basically, Ryuji's ability is charged attacks, Makoto's is motorcycle, Haru can hold her strong attacks out, etc.. Building your party around which playstyles you like right from the get go is nice too.\n\nStory wise and in play, it feels like Persona 5-2. Some scenes have already gotten to me emotionally, and if you wanted less black-and-white themes in Persona 5 and more gray, you should be pleased with the Jail Monarchs in this game. Jumping right back in with the old cast feels natural, and while you can tell the writers had fun referencing the community, everyone feels like they're still them.\nI also like the implication that everyone isn't starting from ground zero as Phantom Thieves; they're rusty, but they're still more than capable of taking out hordes of shadows by themselves.\n\nI don't like out of 10 ratings, so I'll say this is a damn fun game and I recommend it to anyone who likes Persona 5. If you haven't played 5, I do REALLY recommend playing that first, but this game honestly doesn't do a terrible job reviewing what is what for first timers.\nEven if you don't like Musou, you might be pleasantly surprised.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "0d147b40b6e2530197ce28464e4f046c", "author": "77e50fd825a958da8b779d8ccbd83861", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 8791, "content": "Counter Strike.mp3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "421a4126d45e5a35959617fa898a2191", "author": "0e546722ee3d5d54ac1697d5c6267147", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1897, "content": "\u4f60\u61c2\u4e0d\u61c2\u5362\u5e03\u6717\u9996\u4efb\u5916\u6d3e\u53a8\u5e08\u7684\u542b\u91d1\u91cf\u554a^^", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 202, "funny": 174, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "a06eec652b475203bc6f88ac0c3ad6d0", "author": "f3b163e6fe8e5e1db82e539d3453bee0", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3101, "content": "Dare I say, this is even better than the original P5.\nI love the rpg genre as a whole, and Persona 5 does an amazing job with it, but the action style \"dynasty warriors\" gameplay of this manages to get me a lot more invested in the game.\nYou feel like such a badass mowing through crowds of enemies with huge AoE attacks.\nThe story is also really interesting. I love the whole \"roadtrip across japan\" thing they have going on.\n[spoiler] The structure of the villains isn't too bad either, I love the idea of showing a character that's pretty much every respective phantom thief if they had taken a different route in life. [/spoiler]\nAlso Haru is the best girl in all of existence so any more interactions with her is always a plus in my book.\n\nThe only 2 cons I can see are kind of nit-picky.\n1: It doesn't include any mention of the additional story of p5 royal, but I can understand that since the japanese version of this game released before royal was added. That doesn't stop me from wanting to see more of Kasumi and Maruki, though.\n2: There's a few quality of life features taken away compared to base persona 5, like not being able to \"jog\" in the overworld. I can understand that since it was developed in part by a different studio, though.\n\nEasily the best thing in this game is that it doesn't feel like it's 90% cutscenes and it doesn't super hold your hand in the beginning like p5 did. Heck, you can skip cutscenes entirely if you want, rather than having to fast forward through them.\n\n[b] Overall: Phenomenal game. I can easily see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game trying to 100% it, like I have with every other Persona game, from 1 to 5. \nIf you enjoy games like dynasty warriors or hyrule warriors, and you like the story of persona 5, I can not recommend this game enough.[/b]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS",

musou games over the years and this one is by far the best one yet\n\nPros\n-It feels more like persona game with musou combat rather than a mosou game with a persona skin on it\n-fully voiced with great performances \n-music is fantastic as youd expect out of a persona game\n-Menus are all snappy and best in class visuals that the persona series is known for\n-combat is snappy and fluid with a good bit of strategy and the persona weakness system you've grown to know\n-solid world design and plot \n-story takes a front row here which is a nice change for these types of 1v1000 games \n-very stylish across the board it just all looks great \n-super low pc impact even at 1440p i dont think my 2080ti  went over 40c and at a rock solid 60fps (though it is capped at 60 no option for 120 or 144)\n\nCons\n-Combat can seem repetative but if you like these games already you know what your in for \n-tutorial is a bit extreme the first 2 hours it seems like every 2 minutes a new one pops up, i get it for new players to both persona or musou but it is a bit much for anyone familiar with either or both really\n-Locked at 30 or 60fps no 90/120/144 which for some can be a deal breaker but it is super smooth and responsive. \n-did crash once upon loading into a dungeon but no hiccups otherwise really solid port\n\nin conclusion i think if you like either type of game its worth a shot its much better right out of the gate than hyrule warriors age of calamity and again for any of the musou crossovers this one really takes the styling of its source material to heart i cant stress enough how much it feels like a persona game first and foremost. \n\nif you are looking for more PS5 or more persona in generally i think its well worth a shot i cant speak yet to its length but it feels like a minimum 40-50 hours.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id":

spend multiple hundreds of hours into the original base game of Persona 5, I can say for certain that this is a love letter to everyone who has played the base Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\n[h1] Story (without major spoilers) [/h1]\n\nAfter the events of the main game, the protagonist returns to Tokyo for a visit after he was away for half a year. He and the rest of his Friends decided to go camping after they've got reunited. \nWhile they were gathering equipment for that camping trip, they stumbled across the metaverse yet again but this time, it's used to steal the desires from innocent people to affect them in the real world. \nThe Phantom Thieves of hearts are back from their hiatus and ready to get those stolen desires back!\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nUnlike the other persona spin-offs that were either turn based (like the main games) or 2d fighting games, this one is actually a hack and slay with persona traits in it like: \nweakness and resist, all out attacks, 1 more, debuffs and buffs, baton pass, the third eye, ambush and of course the ability to switch personas via wildcard (which is Joker). \nBut they also added many new things that are quite interesting like: \nbonds, master arts, showtimes, gaining personas by random drops, being able to use surroundings as an advantage and so on.\nThe dungeon crawling is also a big part of this game, so be prepared to slice through countless enemies while exploring the cognitive world!    \n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\nWhat is there more to say? If you have played the main game, then you know every single persona Ost is a bop and this time it's no exception.\n\nYearning to hear some good old Persona classics come back, like \"rivers in the desert\" ? Fear not, this game won't let you down. \nYou want \"last surprise\" but more funky? Here you go buddy!\nYou want new Osts that slap ass? Well with axe to grind and daredevil, there's nothing you can do wrong. \nThrough the Legacy BGM Dlc which is available through the deluxe edition, it is also possible to change the Battle theme to another one of the previous games.\n\n\n[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]\n\nEven though I haven't played that much hack and slay in general, I still enjoyed this kind of experience. \nI think this game is a great addition to the persona franchise and a fresh take on the hack and slay genre. \nThe only thing I can recommend in addition is playing the main game before touching this game, to improve your understanding of the following story as well some parts of the gameplay.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 8, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "ddd9dd233eff59838259bee028f0b27f", "author": "9b340413df0159b09e93250460b8b2a5", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2012, "content": "Worth it for Makoto alone", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "aa0e2fcdeb405ec2bf09b326e6b7b7fe", "author": "3df5a542f9e654509dd25d73d077f2f7", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 6628, "content": "**** you Atlus, I take a lot of time to kill boss and crash before I can save.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "289b4ebee1ef5ac79e690d8bfd4709dd", "author": "b008e6f22d7555b3a95db9271a9756b2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 1250, "content": "\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u80fd\u5168\u5c4f\u548c\u65e0\u8fb9\u6846\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u6e38\u73a9\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u52a8\u753b\u573a\u666f\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u9ed1\u5c4f\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5c3d\u5feb\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd8\u662f\u79fb\u690d\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u901a\u75c5\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u624b\u67c4\u6e38\u73a9\u3002", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "8d7cab99ef1e51bebe2979648a9f99ca", "author": "e1ed4521fa025dd2ae834b023571e2b2", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4007, "content": "Sophia has a beautifull voice 10/10 would buy it again.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "266d654d061550628825b78c36b629e5", "author": "417f4da0399455a18192e6ac7c97e98f", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4647, "content": "You can ride a skateboard while the Persona 2 battle themes play.\n\n10 out of 10.", "comments": 13, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1128, "funny": 124, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "74c2430e28ee5c139d0cfa2edcbd3feb", "author": "e43bbd49853b56b696ca9102d9fd66e3", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 8781, "content": "What more can I say?

Character writing/voice acting is a real delight, the game's combat is a fantastic blend of action-RPGs (not unlike KH2 with its Reaction Commands) and the Persona series.

The effort the developers went through to keep the spirit of Persona 5 alive and translate it into a different genre are quite admirable.

The only let down is the lack of a remix of Take Over from Persona 5 Royal, but that's another matter.\n\nCombat feels good for the most part, continuing the gameplay mechanics of the mainline Persona games of hitting an enemies weaknesses in combat.

The bugs for now however need to be fixed. Still 1000 percent recommend, but the crashing and lag in cutscenes among numerous other glitches just take away from the experience for a bit. I have already for example lost 2 hours of play time due to crashing. \n\nYou should still buy it, its really fun and a unique twist. \nSave frequently and if your cutscenes are screwed like mine you can find them on YouTube to watch them to full potential\n\n\nEdit: After finishing game, its up there on my favourite games list. As much as the fandom groans and complains about milking the series the quality for the product is really here with Strikers. The new characters are great, I'm still not sure how I feel about Royal not being connected what so ever plus the weird ending of Royal. If we take that out of the picture I think this ending after connecting to base P5 is really good. Once again the OST is phenomenal as with pretty much every Persona game. Definitely some things I'm going to add to my playlist from this game. The combat also feels really good and is a unique change of pace that still keeps Persona mechanics. \n\nMy only gripes with this game are the bugs. I know Atlus is working on it however I did not get a single cutscene that wasn't a laggy mess. As I mentioned above I had to go on YouTube to see them to their full potential. That being said when they aren't a laggy mess the cutscenes and the characters/environments look great here.\n\nFrom here on forward I couldn't really say whether I'd rather P5's characters get more arc or not. One could obviously make the argument that its being milked harder then P4 even but I wouldn't complain with one last sendoff from the P5 cast. Whether it be a P5 arena or a completely new spinoff. Or we could immediately go to P6 which I wouldn't complain about either. \n\nI started with P5 as my first game and then played P4 here on Steam. Who knows what in store for the anniversary but I would love to see P3 get the Persona 4 Remaster treatment. Beyond that, if Atlus started bringing more releases to Steam I think that would be great. \n\nTime for me to wait to try out Nocturne as my first entry into SMT", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 0, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "64739edef06c576496ca086eaadee4fe", "author": "6bfceaf4bbbd534baf95356ec9f1d24c", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2148, "content": "Sophia is so cute!\n\nNow draw her farting.", "comments": 7, "source": "steam", "helpful": 24, "funny": 38, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "62f5c3a44ce05583ae68419474e9704f", "author": "627c71b22ed05a889b8472f10c404b88", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 3271, "content": "Musou combat + persona combat hurts my brain", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "c548a44ebf625f02b2cad51ad1eefacd", "author": "8a818589ae895872bc3fece8405d1644", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 2745, "content": "I'm usually very iffy on crowd combat games but this nails it very well.

Also, I should not that you won't have as much social interactions as in previous entry, which might disappoint some people.\n\nThe plot feels strong (tho I find it a little bit repetitive), new characters are unique as it usually happens in Persona games.\n\nAnyway, if you are a Persona 5 and/or hack-slash games fan, you should get this game.

However, If you're looking for an RPG experience like the typical persona games, you won't find it here. It is a more \"on the rails\" linear storyline. That being said, if you enjoy hack and slash gameplay or are invested in the characters, I can't reccomend the game enough. All the praises I could say about the game, you will likely hear from the others. What I do want to do is give some notes for those who are on the fence about the game/wonder about technicalities about the PC port.\n\nSome notes:\n       - As many have noted, this game has a LOT going on at once on your screen. The combat starting out will be clunky, stiff, and a bit challenging at first. You could say there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to this game. But give it some time and you'll eventually learn to filter out the noise and navigate battles like an expert. Making use of your dash and your special (Y button on the controller) will allow for some of the most fluid combat I've gotten a chance to play in a hack and lash.\n\n       - This game is an anti aliasing nightmare. If you can, before starting a new game, turn on anti aliasing and crank up the resoulution scale to 2.0. In classic persona fashion, you won't be able to access the pause menu until you get through the tutorials.\n\n        - This game is locked to 60fps. It's a real shame considering I wanted to make full use of my 144hz monitor, but we'll have to see if we'll get a community mod for that, or if it's set to 60 because the game logic will break because of a high framerate.\n\n        - The voice mixing in this game is kind of horrendous. Characters sound different (especially joker) and in some parts, voices are too quiet, like the VAs were standing too far away from the microphones. Still, this is an amazing feat considering that all of the voicework was recorded from home due to COVID-19 restrictions\n\n        - The battles are fairly easy for me, and I've played only a few hack and slash's growing up. If you are a hack and slash expert, I'd put the difficulty on \"hard\". You are free to change the difficulty whenever you wish during the game.\n\n        -  There is a lot of reading, like traditional persona games. If you're not into that, you may want to give picking this up a second thought.  If you have never played Persona 5, I reccomend watching a playthrough or playing it yourself before jumping into this game as it does not give much background into the plot of P5.\n\nThis game is a whole lot of fun, and I want to thank the developers at Atlus for putting in the time to port this game to PC.

Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!", "comments": 8, "source": "steam", "helpful": 187, "funny": 8, "recommended": true, "franchise": "ATLUS", "gameName": "Persona_5_Strikers"}, {"id": "eb0ac9b463fb536ea590bbe5b544ce14", "author": "eb91764bbd4b5e21be1828ef85b5e1ed", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4484, "content": "Running on i7 9700K, GTX 2070 and 32 GB of RAM\n\nRuns super flawlessly barely using any of my resources available.

For context, long time fan, my first game was Persona 3 for the PS2, didn't finish, came back and finished P3FES around 2011, then bought a vita for P4G a little later, and fell in love with the franchise. I routinely get people into persona so you can imagine my surprise seeing P4G, then this game on steam! That being said, I decided to wait out persona 5 royal for a PC release, but I have played the original P5, so I had to grab this.\n\nWhat a great game! I think this is the best Persona spin off yet, having played the dancing games, fighting games, and persona Q. My last game of theirs was the -- rather disappointing-- Persona Q2. This game, though, Ignore the price tag, it's deserving off the full price, even being a spin off, it feels more like a sequel, with eight dungeons, and a ton to do. The combat is less dynasty warriors than I was expecting, and leans more toward a standard ARPG moveset. Playing on normal, you actually had to pay attention to weaknesses, and definitely couldn't just button mash through the game.\n\nPersona spinoff tropes like the throwaway characters are present here, but I actually liked the characters they added, which I almost never do, except the ones from Persona Q. The areas felt new and interesting, I loved the layout, and things felt much more expansive than Persona 5's Palaces, and that's saying a TON because those were already pretty fleshed out. One is a police officer in a troubled relationship with his daughter and the other is a robot questioning how to be human, which are character designs that are molded from persona 4 and 3 respectively. I was disappointed at first, but they really turned the characters into their own, and they sort of molded into their own, I left the game enjoying their characters a lot more than I did coming in, especially the police officer.\n\nI'm not too fond of the cast of Persona 5 and I still found myself pretty invested in the story. Right when the Palace format started to get boring, they switched things up and had an unexpected ending. That being said, there are a few spoilers for Persona 5, however I believe this game doesn't exist in the continuity of Persona 5 : Royal, so if you're worried about spoilers for that game, you're good. That being said, you have to wonder why we don't have Persona 5, or Royal on steam yet. I know for sure that there are people waiting to play this, since it's basically a sequel to the original. The character and bonus content that was revealed in Royal doesn't seem to affect the cast of this game's continuity, very strange considering the events of P3FES are considered canon, same for P4G.\n\n\nGreat port, I had a few crashes but they were following about 7 hours of consecutive play (oops). Other than that, great optimization, Persona 5's graphics look so much better at 4K 60fps! Great job as always Atlus, i'd love to see Royal on here, as well as Persona Q and some of the other spin off games! If you're on the fence, grab it to support Atlus' PC presence! They were already pretty Anti-PC for years, and i'm thinking the sales of P4G are what coaxed them into releasing more on here. Amazing game, the soundtrack I actually like better than the original.
